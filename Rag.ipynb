For too many, especially for younger \\nCanadians, that promise is at risk.  \\nWe have a plan to fix that. We have a plan to build a Canada that works better \\nfor you, where you can get ahead, where your hard work pays off, where you \\ncan buy a home—where you have a fair chance at a good middle class life.  \\nFirst, we’re building more affordable homes. Because the best way to make \\nhome prices more affordable is to increase supply—and quickly. That’s why \\nwe’re cutting red tape and reforming zoning. We’re building more apartments \\nand affordable housing across the country and unlocking public lands and \\nvacant government offices to build homes for Canadians.  \\nFor Millennial and Gen Z renters, we’re restoring the chance to make progress \\ntowards homeownership. We’re creating more tax-free ways to save for your \\nfirst down payment. We’re giving renters credit for rental payments, so when \\nit comes time to apply for that first mortgage, you’ll have a better chance \\nof qualifying.  \\nSecond, we’re making life cost less. We’re strengthening Canada’s social \\nsafety net for every generation. $10‑a‑day child care is already saving young \\nparents thousands of dollars a year—and offering more young Canadians the \\npossibility of starting their own family. New programs to help with the cost of \\ngoing to the dentist and pharmacy, including the cost of contraceptives and \\ninsulin, will further ease the financial burden. And we’re investing so our \\ncommunities are great places to live, work, and raise a family.  \\nThird, we are growing the economy in a way that’s shared by all. We have a \\nplan that will increase investment, enhance productivity, and encourage the \\nkind of game-changing innovation that will create good-paying and meaningful \\njobs and keep Canada at the economic forefront. We’re working to empower \\nmore of our best entrepreneurs and innovators to put their ideas to work here \\nin Canada.  \\nWe are making Canada’s tax system more fair by asking the wealthiest to pay \\ntheir fair share—so we can invest in prosperity for every generation, and \\nbecause it would be irresponsible and unfair to pass on more debt to the next \\ngenerations.  \\nOur government first came to office with a vow to strengthen and expand the \\nmiddle class. We delivered on that pledge by reducing poverty, especially for \\nchildren and seniors, and creating millions of good jobs for Canadians. Our \\nwork isn’t over. '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='ii  \\nOur renewed focus today is unlocking the door to the middle class for millions \\nof younger Canadians. We’ll build more housing and help make life cost less. \\nWe will drive our economy toward growth that lifts everyone up. Because that is \\nwhat you have earned, and that is what you deserve. And that is what your \\nparents and grandparents want for you, too. \\nThe\\n Honourable Chrystia Freeland, P.C., M.P. \\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='   iii \\nTable of Contents \\nEconomic and Fiscal Overview ........................................................................................... 1 \\n1.

expectations. In the face of higher \\ninterest rates, Canada has avoided the recession that some had predicted. \\nInflation has fallen from its June 2022 peak of 8.1 per cent to 2.9 per cent in \\nJanuary and to 2.8 per cent in February 2024. The labour market remains solid. \\nOver 1.1 million more Canadians are employed today than before the \\npandemic, marking the fastest jobs recovery in the G7 (Chart 1). Real wages \\n(wages adjusted for inflation) have gone up, meaning Canadians, on average, \\nhave more purchasing power. And, our economy is growing, with data from \\nStatistics Canada revealing that real GDP at basic prices grew 0.6 per cent in \\nJanuary (7.4 per cent annualized), and preliminary estimates pointing to \\n0.4 per cent growth in February (4.9 per cent annualized), suggesting that \\ngrowth in the first quarter of 2024 is on track for around 3.5 per cent. \\nPrivate sector forecasters expect that the year ahead should bring further \\nprogress. By the end of the year, they expect economic growth will pick up, \\ninterest rates will be lower, and inflation will decline to about 2 per cent. Both the \\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-\\noperation and Development (OECD) project that Canada will see the strongest \\neconomic growth in the G7 in 2025. \\nAt the same time, Canadians are facing challenges as some of the biggest factors \\nfor costs of living, such as groceries and housing, remain elevated. For too many \\nCanadians, hard work isn’t paying off. Our government won’t let them get left \\nbehind. For younger Canadians who are concerned that they may not achieve the \\nsame standard of living as previous generations, we are helping them reach their \\nfull potential. Millennials are now the largest Canadian generation, having \\nsurpassed baby boomers in July 2023. Millennials’ success in the workforce is \\nCanada’s success. We will ensure they succeed by boosting innovation, increasing \\nproductivity, in turn, raising wages and creating more good jobs—ensuring that \\nCanada’s economy reaches its full potential. \\nOngoing investments—including in the Canada Child Benefit, Canada-wide \\naffordable child care, housing construction, and enhanced benefits and pensions \\nfor seniors—are making life more affordable for Canadians and improving access \\nto housing. Investments in economic growth and competitiveness are already \\nshowing results—Canada received the highest per capita foreign direct \\ninvestment in the G7 in the first three quarters of 2023 (Chart 2).

Recent Economic Developments \\nCanada’s Economy is Outperforming Expectations \\nThe Canadian economy is doing better than expected. In the face of rapid and \\nsubstantial increases in interest rates to tame inflation, growth has slowed but \\noutperformed expectations in 2023. Canada avoided the recession expected \\nby many forecasters (Chart 3), with real GDP rising by 1.1 per cent in 2023, \\nover three times higher than what was forecasted in Budget 2023 \\n(0.3 per cent). \\nCanada’s economy is growing. Despite some temporary factors such as the \\nQuebec public sector strikes late in 2023, real GDP rose by 1 per cent on an \\nannualized basis in the fourth quarter, driven by strong global demand for \\nCanadian exports, as well as resilient demand from households for goods and \\nservices. Economic indicators are also encouraging so far in 2024. With the \\neconomy benefiting from a boost from the unwinding of temporary factors, this \\ntranslated into strong real GDP gains in January (7.4 per cent annualized) and \\npreliminary February (4.9 per cent annualized). This suggests that growth in the \\nfirst quarter of 2024 is on track for around 3.5 per cent annualized. In recent \\nmonths, household and small business sentiment has also been more positive.  \\nCanada’s strong economic fundamentals have helped the economy weather the \\nimpacts of higher interest rates. These strong fundamentals include solid labour \\nmarkets driving ongoing gains in workers’ income, as well as solid household \\nand business balance sheets. \\nThe surprising strength of the U.S. economy has also been a factor supporting \\nCanada’s better-than-expected performance (Chart 4). Growth in the U.S. has \\nfar outpaced expectations, driving solid external demand for Canadian goods \\nand services, as well as foreign direct investment in Canada, which provided a \\nsizeable boost to the Canadian economy throughout the past year.  \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='4    Economic and Fiscal Overview  \\nChart 3 \\nReal GDP Growth Relative to \\nBudget 2023 Forecast \\nChart 4 \\nReal GDP Growth From 2022Q4 to \\n2023Q4, G7 Economies \\n  \\n* The data point for 2024 Q1 is the handoff from real \\nGDP by industry at basic prices (3.5 per cent) using \\nactual data for January, preliminary data for February \\nand assuming GDP is unchanged in March. \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance \\nCanada February 2023 survey of private sector \\neconomists; Department of Finance Canada \\ncalculations. \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Haver Analytics. \\n \\nSubstantial Progress Bringing Inflation Back to Target  \\nInflation emerged as a major global economic challenge, which persisted as the \\nglobal economy recovered from the pandemic. This reflected numerous global \\nfactors, including pandemic-related disruptions, supply chain congestion, and \\nrebounding global demand for goods, as well as surging commodity prices \\nfollowing Russia’s illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Since central banks \\naround the world swiftly increased interest rates, inflation in Canada has come \\ndown from its June 2022 peak of 8.1 per cent to 2.8 per cent in February 2024. \\nIn response to rising inflation, the Bank of Canada rapidly raised its benchmark \\ninterest rate by 4.75 percentage points to 5 per cent, as of July 2023—where it \\nremains today. Falling energy prices and an easing of global supply-chain \\nchallenges have also been key drivers of the substantial decline in inflation seen \\nsince the second half of 2022.  \\nToday, inflation has been within the Bank of Canada’s target range of 1 to 3 per cent \\nfor the past two months. This is significant progress in bringing down inflation for \\nCanadians. Progress on inflation remains uneven, especially as it relates to shelter \\nprice inflation, owing significantly to the rise in mortgage interest costs (Chart 5). \\nPrivate sector forecasters expect inflation to remain around 3 per cent through the \\nfirst half of 2024 and then to gradually decline to close to 2 per cent by the end of \\nthe year (Chart 6). \\n-2\\n-1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n2023\\nQ1\\n2023\\nQ2\\n2023\\nQ3\\n2023\\nQ4\\n2024\\nQ1*\\n2023\\nBudget 2023 Actual\\nper cent, period to period at annual rates\\nQuarterly Annual\\n-1 0 1 2 3 4\\nUnited Kingdom\\nGermany\\nItaly\\nFrance\\nCanada\\nJapan\\nUnited States\\nper cent'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content=' Economic and Fiscal Overview    5 \\nDespite recent improvements in inflation, some of the key household costs for \\nCanadians, such as groceries and housing, remain elevated. Addressing these \\nchallenges for the long-term requires targeted policies to solve the underlying \\nstructural issues that are behind the high cost of essentials for Canadians. This is \\na key focus of Budget 2024.  \\nInflation for groceries has fallen from a peak of 11.4 per cent in January 2023 to \\n2.4 per cent in February 2024. This marked the first time grocery prices rose \\nmore slowly than headline inflation since the fall of 2021. However, grocery \\nprices are still up 19 per cent overall since October 2021. To help Canadians \\nwith the cost of groceries, the government will deliver new targeted relief to \\nexpand school food programming across the country. The government also \\ncontinues its work to strengthen competition in the grocery sector to provide \\nmore choices to Canadians and help stabilize prices. We have done this by \\nreforming competition law and empowering the Competition Bureau, which is \\nresponsible for enforcing competition law to crack down on unfair practices \\nthat drive up prices. \\nThe cost of housing is similarly elevated. Rent inflation averaged 6.4 per cent in \\n2023 and, at 8.2 per cent in February, it remains too high for Canadians (Chart \\n7). Mortgage interest costs have also risen sharply. Many Canadians who need \\nto renew their mortgage this year or next will face substantial increases in their \\naverage monthly payment.  \\nCanada has a longstanding housing shortage and building the homes needed \\nto restore housing affordability will require a great national effort—and it is an \\neffort that the federal government is leading. \\nChart 5 \\nInflation Excluding Mortgage Cost  \\nChart 6 \\nConsumer Price Inflation Outlook  \\n  \\nNote: Last data point is February 2024. \\nSource: Statistics Canada.  \\nNote: Last data point is 2024Q4. \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance \\nCanada March 2024 survey of private sector \\neconomists. \\n2% inflation\\n- 1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nJan\\n2019\\nJan\\n2020\\nJan\\n2021\\nJan\\n2022\\nJan\\n2023\\nJan\\n2024\\nper cent, year over year\\nBudget 2024\\n(March 2024 \\nsurvey)\\n2% inflation\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n2019\\nQ4\\n2020\\nQ4\\n2021\\nQ4\\n2022\\nQ4\\n2023\\nQ4\\n2024\\nQ4\\nper cent, year over year'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='6    Economic and Fiscal Overview  \\nBuilding More Homes \\nToday, for too many Canadians—whether in big cities or small towns—the \\ndream of homeownership feels out of reach, and higher rent is making it \\ndifficult to find an affordable place to call home.  \\nCanada’s affordability pressures are rooted in a longstanding challenge of \\ninsufficient new housing supply to meet growing demand. For decades, the \\nconstruction of new homes has been constrained by entrenched structural \\nbarriers, including zoning restrictions, lengthy permitting processes, and \\nskilled labour shortages. The result is that vacancy rates have fallen, driving \\nup house prices and rents. More recently, a rapid increase in population has \\nboosted housing demand and put additional strains on Canada’s ability to \\nproperly welcome these newcomers. \\nRental market pressures, in particular, have intensified over the past year with \\nstrong underlying demand as homeownership unaffordability kept \\nhouseholds in the rental market for longer. Nationally, the cost of rent is up \\n8.2 per cent compared to a year ago, rising at its fastest pace since the early \\n1980s (Chart 7). Pressures are broad-based across the country and reflect \\nexceptionally tight rental market conditions, with the rental vacancy rate \\ndropping to just 1.5 per cent in 2023, its lowest level since at least 1988.  \\nRestoring housing affordability for Canadians requires a substantial and \\nsustained increase in new housing supply. The federal government is \\nincreasing investment, attracting and retaining construction workers, and \\ncutting red tape to jumpstart housing construction across the country. These \\ninvestments are having an impact, notably in the rental market, with \\nconstruction of purpose-built rental housing units accelerating well above \\nhistorical norms (Chart 8).  \\nThe government is also announcing additional measures in Budget 2024 to \\nreduce barriers to new construction for homebuilders, build affordable \\nhousing and provide shelter to those without homes, and make it more \\naffordable to rent and own a home.

Even as the economy has slowed and \\ninterest rates have risen, the labour market has remained solid. The \\nunemployment rate, at 6.1 per cent, is low by historical standards (Chart 9). \\nWhile hiring has slowed and job vacancies have declined in recent months, this \\nhas occurred without significant layoffs. Strong population growth and \\nhistorically high working-age participation—particularly among women—have \\nhelped businesses fill a record-high level of job vacancies. Supported by the new \\nCanada-wide system of early learning and child care, more women are \\nparticipating in the labour force than ever before. \\nA strong labour market also matters for affordability. Wage growth has outpaced \\ninflation for the past 13 months. On average, real wages—wages after accounting \\nfor inflation—are now higher than they were just prior to the pandemic, a \\npositive sign that the purchasing power of Canadians has strengthened despite \\nglobal economic hurdles. Overall, real average weekly earnings have risen by 4.6 \\nper cent since 2019 (Chart 10). Consequently, over the course of a year, a worker \\nearning the average weekly wage (before taxes) of $1,270 today can afford the \\nsame basket of goods and services as in 2019 with an additional $2,900 left over \\nat the end of the year to save or spend. Moreover, household average wealth \\nafter inflation has increased by 8.9 per cent between 2019 and 2023.

As with earnings, wealth gains have been broad-\\nbased across the income distribution, with the lowest income group seeing \\nthe fastest growth (and this was felt across all age groups).

This has led to a longstanding \\nproductivity gap, notably with the United States. Expanding the productive \\ncapacity of the Canadian economy and overcoming Canada’s productivity \\nchallenges are essential. Enhancing productivity growth is pivotal for reinforcing \\nthe economy’s strength, resilience, and competitiveness and for elevating \\nCanadians’ living standards. Key to unlocking Canada’s full economic potential \\nis building confidence for businesses to make the investments needed to \\nimprove productivity and keep pace with rapidly developing markets, and the \\nneeds of an economy in transition to net-zero. \\nThe government has made significant investments to nurture an environment in \\nwhich businesses have the confidence to invest. These policies include \\ninvestments in health care, early learning and child care, better integration of \\nnewcomers, boosting housing supply, and fostering historic investments for the \\nnet-zero transition. These investments ensure people are healthy and able to \\ncontribute to their full potential in the labour force. And there are already signs \\nthat these policies have started to pay off.  \\nAffordable child care has helped enable Canada’s labour force participation rate \\nfor women in their prime working years to reach a record high of 85.7 per cent \\nin September 2023, compared to just 77.4 per cent in the United States.  \\n-1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\nBottom\\n20%\\nSecond Third Fourth Top\\n20%\\nIncome quintile\\nper cent \\n-5\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\nBottom\\n20%\\nSecond Third Fourth Top\\n20%\\nIncome quintile\\nper cent '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='10    Economic and Fiscal Overview  \\nNet-zero investments have contributed to Canada being recognized by \\nBloombergNEF as having the strongest electric vehicle supply chain potential in \\nthe world—leapfrogging the previous frontrunner, China, and the United States. \\nCanada has also been recognized for its world-class reserves of critical minerals, \\nranking first in mining potential as determined by global companies in the \\nsector (Chart 13).

These strengths \\nhave led many multinational firms to announce significant battery \\nmanufacturing plant investments in Canada. \\nTo seize the investment opportunities of the global clean economy, the \\ngovernment is delivering, on a priority basis, six major economic investment tax \\ncredits, which represent $93 billion in federal incentives.

This has been a \\nfactor in the recent decline in GDP per capita. The government recently \\nannounced it will reduce the share of temporary residents in Canada to 5 per \\ncent of the total population over the next three years. This will lead to \\napproximately 600,000 fewer temporary residents compared to current \\nlevels, which will result in a significant easing in demand across the housing \\nmarket. \\nGiven newcomers typically earn less than the average Canadian upon arrival, \\na large one-time increase in the number of newcomers has weighed on \\naverage income and productivity in the short-term. This should not be \\nmisinterpreted to imply that those already in the country are becoming \\nworse off. Over time, this composition effect will fade as newcomers \\nintegrate into the economy. \\nIn recent years, newcomers to Canada have steadily improved their \\nintegration into the labour market, with each newcomer wave seeing smaller \\ninitial income gaps than those in the past. Looking specifically at the \\noutcomes of economic immigrants over the most recent ten-year period, it \\ntook six years for them to reach the median Canadian income. By the end of \\nthe decade after their arrival, they surpassed the median Canadian income \\nby close to ten per cent. \\nWhile the economy has been resilient, growth in Canada has softened in the \\nface of elevated inflation and higher interest rates, just as it has across the \\nglobe. In 2015, the oil price shock caused a temporary decline in GDP per \\ncapita of 1 per cent, which was recovered two years later.  \\nAs a result, the government expects GDP per capita to recover along with \\nthe further integration of newcomers into the Canadian labour market and \\nthe normalization of the post-pandemic immigration surge over the next \\nfew years. \\nNewcomer settlement time, combined with the government’s investments in \\neconomic growth, mean weakness in GDP per capita is largely temporary, \\nnot systemic.

Canadian Economic Outlook \\nPrivate Sector Economists Expect a Soft Landing  \\nThe average of private sector forecasts has been used as the basis for economic \\nand fiscal planning in Canada since 1994, helping to ensure objectivity and \\ntransparency, and introducing an important element of independence into the \\ngovernment’s economic and fiscal forecast.  \\nThe Department of Finance Canada surveyed a group of private sector \\neconomists in March 2024. Overall, the private sector economists surveyed \\nexpect the economy to avoid a recession, seeing moderate below-potential \\ngrowth of roughly 1 per cent on average over the year weighed down by the \\neffects of past interest rate increases (Chart 17). Growth is then expected to \\nstrengthen slightly above 2 per cent in the first two quarters of 2025. Overall, \\nprivate sector economists expect growth of 0.7 per cent in 2024 and 1.9 per cent \\nin 2025, compared to, respectively, 0.5 per cent and 2.2 per cent in the 2023 Fall \\nEconomic Statement (restated for historical revisions).  \\nAs the Canadian economy moderates, the unemployment rate is expected to \\nrise to a peak of 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year and average \\n6.3 per cent in 2024 (compared to, respectively, 6.5 per cent and 6.4 per cent in \\nthe 2023 Fall Economic Statement). The unemployment rate is expected to \\nremain low by historical standards, and far below the peaks typically seen in \\nrecessions. \\nPrivate sector economists expect CPI inflation to ease to about 2 per cent by the \\nend of 2024 and to average 2.5 per cent for the year as a whole, the same as \\nprojected in the 2023 Fall Economic Statement. '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='18    Economic and Fiscal Overview  \\nShort-term interest rates are expected to decline from an average of 4.8 per \\ncent in 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024 and to 3.1 per cent in 2025, about 20 basis \\npoints higher in each year compared to the 2023 Fall Economic Statement \\n(Chart 18). Short-term interest rates are then expected to settle at 2.7 per cent \\nover the last three years of the forecast horizon. The outlook for long-term \\ninterest rates has been revised up by about 10 basis points on average per year \\ncompared to the 2023 Fall Economic Statement.  \\nGDP inflation in the second half of last year was stronger than expected in the \\n2023 Fall Economic Statement. GDP inflation averaged 1.6 per cent for the year \\nas a whole, compared to 1 per cent expected in the 2023 Fall Economic \\nStatement. As well, private sector economists have revised up their outlook for \\n2024 to 3.0 per cent (compared to 2.0 per cent in the 2023 Fall Economic \\nStatement), while 2025 has been revised down slightly to 1.9 per cent (from \\n2.0 per cent). In the outer years, GDP inflation is expected to be slightly lower by \\nabout 0.1 percentage points on average per year. \\nReflecting higher-than-expected GDP inflation in the second half of last year, \\nthe level of nominal GDP in 2023 came in $18 billion higher than projected in \\nthe 2023 Fall Economic Statement. Furthermore, the nominal GDP level \\ndifference with the 2023 Fall Economic Statement is expected to increase to \\n$56 billion in 2024 reflecting stronger near-term outlook for both real GDP \\ngrowth and GDP inflation. However, because of lower GDP inflation in the outer \\nyears and slower expected real GDP growth in 2025 and 2026, the nominal GDP \\nlevel difference with the 2023 Fall Economic Statement gradually declines over \\nthe last four years of the forecast horizon to average $39 billion per year over \\nthat period. \\nChart 17 \\nReal GDP Growth Projections \\nChart 18 \\nShort-Term Interest Rates Outlook \\n  \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance \\nCanada September 2023 and March 2024 surveys of \\nprivate sector economists. \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance \\nCanada September 2023 and March 2024 surveys of \\nprivate sector economists. \\n-1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n2023\\nQ3\\n2023\\nQ4\\n2024\\nQ1\\n2024\\nQ2\\n2024\\nQ3\\n2024\\nQ4\\n2025\\nQ1\\n2025\\nQ2\\n2023 2024 2025\\nFES 2023 (September 2023 survey)\\nBudget 2024 (March 2024 survey)\\nper cent, period-to-period at annual rates\\nActual\\nQuarterly Annual\\nActual\\nFES 2023 \\n(September \\n2023 survey)\\nBudget 2024\\n(March 2024 \\nsurvey)\\n2.0\\n2.5\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n4.5\\n5.0\\n5.5\\n2023\\nQ1\\n2023\\nQ3\\n2024\\nQ1\\n2024\\nQ3\\n2025\\nQ1\\n2025\\nQ3\\nper cent \\nForecast'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content=' Economic and Fiscal Overview    19 \\nEconomic Scenario Analysis \\nThe March 2024 survey provides a reasonable basis for economic and fiscal \\nplanning. The economic outlook nevertheless remains clouded by a number of \\nkey uncertainties, which could impact the trajectory of inflation, interest rates, \\nand economic growth.  \\nData on economic growth and inflation released so far this year remain broadly \\nconsistent with a soft landing. However, progress on inflation remains uneven as \\nshelter price inflation has persisted. Long-term interest rates have declined after \\nsurging last year as risks around the growth and inflation outlook have eased, but \\nthere remains considerable uncertainty as to when central banks will begin to cut \\npolicy rates. At the same time, geopolitical tensions have increased owing to \\nheightened uncertainty related to Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, U.S.-China \\nrelations, and Red Sea supply chain disruptions. So far, the impacts have been \\ncontained, but new economic pressures related to these conflicts and geopolitical \\nvolatility impacting confidence and investment decisions remain a risk. \\nTo facilitate prudent economic and fiscal planning, the Department of Finance \\nCanada has developed scenarios that incorporate these uncertainties and \\nconsider faster or slower growth tracks.  \\nThe downside scenario sees a shallow recession in Canada. Various headwinds \\nsuch as structural imbalances in housing markets and spillovers from \\ngeopolitical tensions keep inflation and interest rates elevated for longer than \\nexpected, with adverse effects on confidence and consumer activity. At the \\nsame time, the U.S. also sees persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and \\nsubsequently slower growth. Along with a weaker economic recovery in China, \\nthis contributes to slower global growth. Taken together, these factors result in \\nreal GDP in Canada contracting by 0.1 per cent in 2024 before rebounding \\nmodestly in 2025, compared to a period of moderate growth expected in the \\nsurvey (Chart 19). In addition, slower global growth leads to lower commodity \\nprices. Overall, the level of nominal GDP in Canada is $34 billion below the \\nsurvey, on average per year, in the downside scenario (Chart 20).  \\nIn contrast, the upside scenario sees moderately faster economic growth than in \\nthe survey. A more resilient U.S. economy—underpinned by strong balance \\nsheets for households and firms and recent supply side improvements in \\nproductivity—benefits the Canadian economy through higher export demand \\nand improved global commodity prices. Despite more economic resilience, \\ninflation slows roughly as expected in the survey, both in Canada and globally, \\namid falling input costs. These developments result in economic growth picking \\nup faster than expected in the second half of 2024. The improved global \\noutlook, alongside extended crude oil production cuts by OPEC+, leave oil \\nprices above the survey. Overall, the level of nominal GDP is $34 billion above \\nthe survey, on average per year, in the upside scenario.

Fiscal Outlook \\nCanada’s Responsible Economic Plan  \\nResponsible fiscal stewardship has left Canada in an enviable fiscal position. \\nCanada’s net debt-to-GDP ratio is well below that of our G7 peers. Our deficits \\nare modest and declining, particularly relative to the size of our economy. We \\nare one of only two G7 countries rated AAA by at least two of the three major \\nglobal ratings agencies. This has been achieved through the government’s \\nresponsible economic plan that has enabled proactive investments to support \\nCanadians and Canada’s long-term prosperity, which will have a direct and \\nlasting impact for future generations.  \\nBudget 2024 is a responsible economic plan that makes generational \\ninvestments by raising revenues from those with the greatest ability to pay and \\ninvesting in economic growth and opportunity for every generation. \\nTransformative investments in clean energy, in opportunities for workers, in \\ninnovation, and to improve housing affordability will support a business \\nenvironment that gives investors confidence Canada’s workforce is ready for \\nmore opportunities. This will enable our economy to attract more investment \\nand to create more jobs, supporting reductions to Canada’s net debt- and \\ndeficit-to-GDP ratios, which are already the lowest in the G7.  \\nBudget 2024 supports fairness for every generation by sticking to the fiscal \\nobjectives laid out in the fall economic statement, setting both deficits and the \\nfederal debt burden on a downward track. \\n-1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n2024 2025 2026\\nDownside scenario\\nMarch 2024 survey\\nUpside scenario\\nper cent\\nMarch 2024 \\nsurvey\\nUpside \\nScenario\\nDownside \\nScenario\\n2,800\\n2,850\\n2,900\\n2,950\\n3,000\\n3,050\\n3,100\\n3,150\\n3,200\\n3,250\\n3,300\\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\\nbillions of dollars\\nRange of top four\\nand bottom four\\nprivate sector forecasts'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content=' Economic and Fiscal Overview    21 \\nAs a result of these actions, and incorporating the results of the March 2024 \\nsurvey of private sector economists, the budgetary balance is expected to \\nimprove slightly from the $40.1 billion deficit projected for 2023-24 in Budget \\n2023, at $40 billion or -1.4 per cent of GDP.

For today’s young adults, this promise is under threat.  \\nRising rents are making it hard to find an affordable place to call home and \\nrising home prices are keeping homes out of reach for many first-time buyers. \\nThe ability of an entire generation of Canadians to achieve the promise of \\nCanada is at risk, despite their sheer grit and hard work. Millennials and Gen Z \\nare watching the middle class dream become less and less achievable. They \\nworry that they won’t ever be able to afford the kinds of homes they grew up \\nin. They deserve the same opportunity to own a place of their own as was \\nenjoyed by generations before them. \\nThe government is taking action to meet this moment, and build housing at a \\npace and scale not seen in generations. We did it when soldiers returned home \\nfrom the Second World War, and we can build homes like that again. And we \\ncan make sure that Canadians at every age can find an affordable home. \\nOn April 12, the government released an ambitious plan to build homes by the \\nmillions, Solving the Housing Crisis: Canada’s Housing Plan. It includes our plan \\nto make it easier to afford rent and buy a home, and makes sure that the most \\nvulnerable Canadians have support, too. At the heart of our plan is a \\ncommitment that no hard-working Canadian should spend more than 30 per \\ncent of their income on housing costs. \\nTackling the housing crisis isn’t just about fairness, it’s also about building a \\nstrong economy. When people can afford housing, they can also invest in their \\nlocal community, supporting local businesses and jobs. When workers can \\nafford to live near their jobs, short commutes turn into high productivity. \\nBusinesses want to establish new headquarters in cities where workers can \\nafford to live. When people can more easily save for a down payment, they can \\npursue their dreams, like starting a business. Housing policy is economic policy. \\nBudget 2024 and Canada’s Housing Plan lay out the government’s bold \\nstrategy to unlock 3.87 million new homes by 2031, which includes a \\nminimum of 2 million net new homes on top of the 1.87 million homes \\nexpected to be built anyway by 2031. Of the 2 million net new homes, we \\nestimate that the policy actions taken in Budget 2024, Canada’s Housing Plan, \\nand in fall 2023 would support a minimum of 1.2 million net new homes.

And when new Canadians arrive today, our society \\nis enriched. Canada, like other advanced economies, needs immigrants today \\nmore than ever, given our aging population. Immigrants are essential to \\nmaintaining a young and capable workforce, to ensuring we can find the \\ndoctors, construction workers, nurses, and early childhood educators that \\nwe need. \\nBut our ability to successfully welcome new Canadians depends on having \\nthe physical capacity to do so properly—in particular having enough homes. \\nThat is why current housing pressures mean that Canada is taking a careful \\nlook to make sure immigration does not outpace our ability to supply \\nhousing for all. \\nIt is important to note that Canada’s immigration system has two parts: \\npermanent and temporary.  \\nThroughout Canada’s history, permanent immigration has become subject to \\nextensive consultation with communities, provinces, territories, and \\nemployers. It is planned and designed in collaboration with Canadian society.  \\nHowever, temporary immigration, which includes our student and temporary \\nworker programs, has traditionally been demand-driven, determined by the \\nrequests from international students and workers, and from employers \\nin Canada.  \\n0\\n2,000\\n4,000\\n6,000\\n8,000\\n10,000\\n12,000\\nVancouver Toronto Montreal Calgary Edmonton Ottawa\\nunits'), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='30   Chapter 1 \\nManaging Demand: A Sustainable Immigration Strategy \\nCanada has recently undertaken a review process for our temporary resident \\nprograms, to better align with labour market needs, to protect against \\nabuses in the system, and to match our capacity to build new homes. We will \\nalso be setting targets both for the number of permanent residents we \\nwelcome, and for temporary residents. \\nStarting this fall, for the first time, we will expand the Immigration Levels Plan \\nto include both temporary resident admissions and permanent resident \\nadmissions.  \\nOur ultimate goal is to ensure a well-managed, responsive, and sustainable \\nimmigration system to help balance housing supply with housing demand. \\nWe also need to be sure that our temporary worker programs do not create \\na disincentive for businesses to invest in productivity, or drive down wages in \\nCanada, especially for low-wage workers. \\n \\nSolving the Housing Crisis \\nThe federal government’s plan starts with turbocharging the construction of \\nnew homes across the country because the best way to bring down home \\nprices is to increase supply—and quickly. The government is already making the \\nmath work for homebuilders by breaking down regulatory and zoning barriers, \\nproviding direct low-cost financing, and making more land available. To ensure \\nwe have the workers and innovative construction methods needed to build \\nmore homes, faster, the government is training and recruiting the next \\ngeneration of skilled trades workers, and transforming how homes are built to \\nincrease construction productivity. \\nSecond, to make it easier to own or rent a home, Budget 2024 announces new \\naction to support renters and lower the costs of homeownership. For renters, \\nnew action will help protect them from unfair practices like steep rent increases \\nand renovictions, and unlock new pathways for them to become homeowners, \\nincluding ensuring they get credit for rental payments. For first-time \\nhomebuyers, new support will make it easier to save for their down payment \\nfaster and get their first mortgage.

This includes \\nbuilding more affordable units for low- and middle-income Canadians by \\ninvesting in affordable housing projects and partnering with non-profits, co-\\nops, the private sector, and other orders of government. This also means \\noffering immediate support for Canadians without shelter and Canadians at risk \\nof becoming homeless.  \\nAt the crux of this effort is ensuring that fiscal policy works in tandem with \\nmonetary policy, and that Canada’s immigration policy works in tandem with \\nhousing policy. The government recently announced plans to adjust \\nimmigration programming which would lead to about 600,000 fewer temporary \\nresidents in Canada compared to current levels. These efforts are critical to \\ncreating the necessary conditions to lower interest rates, lower housing \\ndemand, and restore housing affordability.  \\n1.1 Building More Homes \\nBuilding enough homes to restore fair prices and make sure everyone has a place \\nto call home is going to take a Team Canada effort. All orders of government—\\nfederal, provincial, territorial, and municipal—need to work together to remove \\nall barriers that often slow down the construction of new homes. This includes \\nworking together to overcome financial, zoning, and regulatory barriers.  \\nAlready, the $4 billion Housing Accelerator Fund is cutting red tape across the \\ncountry, with 179 agreements with municipalities, provinces, and territories \\nenabling the construction of over 750,000 new homes over the next decade. It \\nis working, so we are topping it up with $400 million to build more homes, \\nfaster, in more communities. \\nUnder a new Canada Builds approach, the federal government is offering to \\npartner with provinces and territories that launch their own ambitious housing \\nplans, with federal financing to help rapidly increase housing supply for \\nCanadians in every province and territory. \\nWe must use every possible tool to build homes at a scale and pace not seen \\nsince the Second World War. The federal government is announcing a range of \\nnew measures to make the math work for homebuilders, unlock the lands \\nneeded to build new homes, cut red tape that holds back new construction, \\nattract and train skilled workers, and accelerate the implementation of \\ninnovative ways to build more homes, faster.

These barriers also contribute to higher costs of building, \\nwhich are then passed on to Canadians. \\nToday, governments across Canada are sitting on surplus, underused, and \\nvacant public lands, such as empty office towers or low-rise buildings that could \\nbe built on. By unlocking these lands for housing, governments can lower the \\ncosts of construction and build more homes, faster, at prices Canadians \\ncan afford.  \\nSince 2016, Canada Lands Company has enabled the construction of more than \\n10,300 new homes on underused federal land, including more than 1,100 \\naffordable homes. Over the next five years, Canada Lands Company currently \\naims to enable the construction of over 29,200 new homes, with a minimum of \\n20 per cent affordable units. Canada Lands Company is working to unlock new \\nhomes each day, but we need to do more, faster.  \\nTo ensure every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home, the \\ngovernment will transform its approach to federally owned land and lead a \\nnational, Team Canada effort to unlock public lands for housing. \\nWhenever possible, public land should be used for homes. Moving forward, the \\nfederal government will partner with the housing sector to build homes on \\nevery possible site across the federal portfolio. By leveraging new approaches \\nto building homes on public lands, such as leasing, the federal government will \\nalso be able to maintain the strengths of its balance sheet.  \\nBy building homes on public lands, the federal government will lead a Team \\nCanada effort to unlock federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal public \\nlands across the country.

Keeping land under public \\nownership and leasing it to builders—instead of selling to the highest \\nbidder—will enable new homes to be affordable, forever. This effort will \\nhelp housing providers avoid unnecessary upfront capital costs, allowing \\nthem to build more affordable housing, all while strengthening the \\nfederal government’s balance sheet to unlock more homes.  \\n The federal government is conducting a rapid review of its entire federal \\nlands portfolio to identify more land for housing. As part of this effort, the \\ngovernment will: \\n\\xad Review the entire portfolio of federally owned land and properties to \\nrapidly identify sites where new homes can be built; \\n\\xad Require departments and agencies to offer up specific parcels of land \\naccording to specified targets; \\n\\xad Consult with municipal, provincial, and private sector partners to \\nidentify the most promising lands to be made available for housing;  \\n\\xad Publish a new Public Land Bank, encompassing an inventory of \\navailable lands, before fall 2024 to accelerate construction on public \\nlands;  \\n\\xad Release a new geo-spatial mapping tool to help homebuilders more \\neasily access and navigate public lands; and,  \\n\\xad Introduce legislation, as required, to facilitate the acquisition and use \\nof public lands for homes, in partnership with other orders of \\ngovernment. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $5 million over three years, starting in \\n2024-25, to support an overhaul of the Canada Lands Company to \\nexpand its activities to build more homes on public lands.

While the federal government owns a large portfolio of land, \\nother orders of government can and should also contribute to this \\nnational effort by leveraging their own public land portfolios. Building on \\nthese sites can be done efficiently as existing infrastructure is already in \\nplace, such as transit, schools, roads, water, electricity, and parks.

This would enable more office buildings, particularly \\nin urban areas, to be converted into homes for Canadians, while also ensuring \\nthe responsible use of government resources. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $1.1 billion over ten years, starting in \\n2024-25, to Public Services and Procurement Canada to reduce its office \\nportfolio by 50 per cent. This funding, which is expected to be fully \\nrecovered through substantial short- and long-term cost savings, will help \\nto accelerate the ending of leases and disposal of underused federal \\nproperties, and address deferred maintenance. Where applicable, the \\ngovernment will prioritize student and non-market housing in the \\nunlocking of federal office properties. \\nReducing the federal office footprint will generate substantial savings, expected \\nto reach $3.9 billion over the next ten years, and $0.9 billion per year ongoing.  \\nTaxing Vacant Lands to Incentivize Construction  \\nAt a time when we need to build as quickly as possible, it makes no sense that \\ngood land, in good areas, is sitting there, underused. As all orders of \\ngovernment put in place policies to tackle housing supply shortages, there is a \\nconcern that some landowners in Canada may be sitting on developable land, \\nhoping to profit from rising land values when the land could instead be used \\nfor immediate residential development. Vacant land needs to be used, and it is \\nbest used to build homes. \\nThe government is taking significant action to resolve Canada’s housing crisis, \\nand the federal government believes owners of vacant land in Canada must also \\ndo their part to unlock unused land for homes.  \\n Budget 2024 announces that the government will consider introducing a \\nnew tax on residentially zoned vacant land. The government will launch \\nconsultations later this year. \\n \\n '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='42   Chapter 1 \\nBuilding Apartments, Bringing Rents Down  \\nBuilding rental homes requires significant investment, even more so when \\ninterest rates and land prices are high, as in recent years. Access to low-cost \\nfinancing can help homebuilders move a rental project from being financially \\nunfeasible to feasible. To help more apartment buildings break ground, the \\ngovernment is investing heavily in its low-cost construction financing programs, \\nensuring homebuilders have the financing needed to keep building.  \\nThe Apartment Construction Loan Program plays a crucial role in filling \\nCanada’s housing supply shortage by providing developers with the necessary \\ncapital to build rental homes. This support accelerates the development of \\napartments in neighbourhoods where people want to live and work. This is \\ngood for people, good for communities, and good for our economy.  \\n To build more rental apartments, faster, Budget 2024 announces an \\nadditional $15 billion in new loan funding, starting in 2025-26, for the \\nApartment Construction Loan Program, bringing the program’s total to \\nover $55 billion. This investment will help build more than 30,000 \\nadditional new homes across Canada, bringing the program’s total \\ncontribution to over 131,000 new homes supported by 2031-32. \\n\\xad Of this amount, at least $100 million will be used to build homes \\nabove existing shops and businesses, especially in big cities where \\nland is scarce and where density is key. \\n To increase access to the program and make it easier for builders to \\nbuild, Budget 2024 announces new reforms to the Apartment \\nConstruction Loan Program. These reforms include:  \\n\\xad Extending the terms of the loans offered; \\n\\xad Extending access to financing to include housing projects for students \\nand seniors; \\n\\xad Introducing a portfolio approach so builders can move forward on \\nmultiple projects at once; \\n\\xad Providing additional flexibility on affordability, energy efficiency, and \\naccessibility requirements; and, \\n\\xad Launching a new frequent builder stream to fast-track the application \\nprocess for proven home builders. \\nThese measures will make it easier, cheaper, and faster to build homes in \\nCanada. For students, it will mean getting the keys to their first home and living \\nclose to campus. For young families, it will mean getting a good home near \\nwork, opportunity, and in a vibrant neighbourhood. And for seniors, it will mean \\nan affordable place where you can downsize with security and dignity.

Loans for \\nsuch developments are typically not available through private lenders, \\nunless syndicated through several lenders to diﬀuse risk, a process which \\nadds signiﬁcant complexity and �me. Private ﬁnancing, with a prime rate \\nabove 7 per cent, is just too costly to make this project viable. Camille \\nHomes Corp. is considering abandoning this project, but instead decides to \\napply for low-cost ﬁnancing from the Apartment Construc�on Loan \\nProgram.  \\nThe Apartment Construction Loan Program’s favourable financing terms, \\nwhich include competitive interest rates, insurance premiums covered by the \\nprogram, and longer terms and amor�za�on periods are reducing \\nborrowers’ building costs by millions of dollars when compared to private \\nﬁnancing.  \\nLow-cost financing and flexible terms, combined with tailored support to \\nmeet the project’s needs, as well as CMHC’s ability to act as a single lender, \\nis making the math on rental buildings work for builders such as Camille \\nHomes Corp. and helping to build more homes across Canada. \\n \\nLaunching Canada Builds  \\nTo build homes across the country, we need a Team Canada approach. \\nProvinces and territories control a number of critical levers to unlocking more \\nhousing supply, such as zoning rules, development approvals, lands and land \\nuse planning, rules for tenants and landlords and the adoption of building \\ncodes and regulations.  \\nThe federal government is supporting a number of provincial and territorial-led \\ninitiatives through cost-shared bilateral housing agreements. Most recently, this \\nincludes partnering with British Columbia in support of the BC Builds initiative \\nwith $2 billion in low-cost financing through the Apartment Construction Loan \\nProgram.  \\nThe federal government’s partnership with BC Builds is a testament to the \\nprogress possible when multiple orders of government work collaboratively to \\ndeliver thousands of new rental homes for people in communities across \\nCanada. '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='More Affordable Homes    45 \\n Building on this momentum, Budget 2024 announces Canada Builds, the \\nfederal government’s intention to leverage its $55 billion Apartment \\nConstruction Loan Program to partner with provinces and territories to \\nbuild more rental housing across the country.  \\n To access federal financing, provinces and territories will be expected to \\nmeet the benchmarks set by BC Builds and deliver action to unlock even \\nmore homes. These actions include: \\n\\xad Complementing federal funds with provincial or territorial investments;  \\n\\xad Building on government, non-profit, community-owned, and vacant \\nlands; \\n\\xad Considering access to early learning and child care, and the expansion \\nof non-profit child care, in the development process; \\n\\xad Streamlining the process to cut development approval timelines to no \\nlonger than 12 to 18 months; and, \\n\\xad Meeting the criteria of the Apartment Construction Loan Program, \\nincluding affordability requirements. \\nThe federal government will initiate discussions with provincial and territorial \\ngovernments as soon as possible. This transformative approach links portfolios \\nof underused land, homebuilders, and federal and provincial investments. This \\nTeam Canada mission will help pave the way for new housing supply across the \\ncountry.  \\nTopping-Up the Housing Accelerator Fund  \\nIn March 2023, the government launched the $4 billion Housing Accelerator \\nFund to work with municipalities to cut red tape and fast-track the creation of \\nat least 100,000 new homes across Canada. Through 179 agreements signed to \\ndate, the government has committed nearly $4 billion to spur the construction \\nof 750,000 new homes across the country over the next decade.  \\n Building on this success, Budget 2024 proposes to provide an additional \\n$400 million over four years, starting in 2024-25, to the Canada Housing \\nand Mortgage Corporation, to top up the Housing Accelerator Fund.

These investments are critical as all orders of \\ngovernment work together to unlock more housing, faster. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $6 billion over 10 years, starting in \\n2024-25, to Infrastructure Canada to launch a new Canada Housing \\nInfrastructure Fund. The Fund will accelerate the construction and \\nupgrading of housing-enabling water, wastewater, stormwater, and solid \\nwaste infrastructure that will directly enable new housing supply and help \\nimprove densification. This Fund will be comprised of: \\n\\xad $1 billion available directly to municipalities to support urgent \\ninfrastructure needs that will directly enable housing supply. \\n\\xad $5 billion for agreements with provinces and territories to support \\nlong-term priorities. Provinces and territories can only access this \\nfunding if they commit to key actions that increase housing supply: \\no Legalize more housing options by adopting zoning that allows four \\nunits as-of-right and that permits more “missing middle” homes, \\nincluding duplexes, triplexes, townhouses, and small multi-unit \\napartments; \\no Implement a three-year freeze on increasing development charges \\nfrom April 2, 2024, levels for municipalities with a population greater \\nthan 300,000; \\no Adopt forthcoming changes to the National Building Code to \\nsupport more accessible, affordable, and climate-friendly housing \\noptions; \\no Provide pre-approval for construction of designs included in the \\ngovernment’s upcoming Housing Design Catalogue; and, \\no Implement measures from the forthcoming Home Buyers’ Bill of \\nRights and Renters’ Bill of Rights. \\n\\xad Provinces will have until January 1, 2025, to secure an agreement, and \\nterritories will have until April 1, 2025.

More homes need to be built \\ncloser to the services that Canadians count on. Transit that is more accessible \\nand reliable means Canadians can spend more time with their friends and \\nfamily. It’s crucial that all orders of government work together to achieve this. \\n Budget 2024 announces that any community seeking to access long-\\nterm, predictable funding through the federal government’s forthcoming \\npermanent public transit fund will be required to take action that directly \\nunlocks housing supply where it is needed most by: \\n\\xad Eliminating all mandatory minimum parking requirements within 800 \\nmetres of a high-frequency transit line; \\n\\xad Allowing high-density housing within 800 metres of a high-frequency \\ntransit line; and, \\n\\xad Allowing high-density housing within 800 metres of post-secondary \\ninstitutions. \\n\\xad Completing a Housing Needs Assessment for all communities with a \\npopulation greater than 30,000. \\nThese are long overdue changes that will mean more people can live near \\ntransit to access the services and opportunities in their communities, and will \\nallow home construction to happen faster and at more affordable prices. \\nThe Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Housing Initiative  \\nAs Canada’s cities and towns build more homes, they need to build more \\ninfrastructure. From water and sewer infrastructure to public transit to high-\\nspeed internet, the federal government is providing municipalities with the \\ntools they need to grow.  \\nThat is why, since 2017, the Canada Infrastructure Bank has made investment \\ncommitments of over $11 billion in more than 50 projects, and catalyzed over \\n$31 billion in total investment, to address critical infrastructure gaps across the \\ncountry. These include: \\n− $1.28 billion for the Réseau express métropolitain in Montréal; \\n− $1.3 billion for rural broadband internet in Ontario; '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='52   Chapter 1 \\n− $165 million for the City of Calgary to buy zero-emission buses; \\n− $138.2 million for energy storage to enable increased renewable \\nelectricity in Nova Scotia; and, \\n− Up to $80 million for the Atlin Hydroelectric Expansion in Yukon. \\nThe 2023 Fall Economic Statement announced that the Canada Infrastructure \\nBank would be exploring further opportunities to support the needs of growing \\ncommunities by helping to finance the infrastructure needed to build more \\nhomes.  \\nIn March 2024, the Canada Infrastructure Bank announced the launch of its \\nInfrastructure for Housing Initiative to provide low-cost financing to enable \\nmunicipalities and Indigenous communities to build housing-enabling \\ninfrastructure.

However, student residences, given their \\ntypically shorter-term and transient nature, may not currently meet the \\nconditions for this rebate. \\n Budget 2024 announces that the eligibility conditions for the removal of \\nGST on new student residences will be relaxed for not-for-profit \\nuniversities, public colleges, and school authorities. This will incentivize \\nCanada’s educational institutions to build more student housing by \\nensuring they benefit from the removal of GST on new student \\nresidences.

If you work hard, and \\nsave your money, you should be able to buy a home. That was the deal for \\ngenerations. But young adults feel like the possibility of owning a home like the \\none they grew up in is less and less likely, as increases in home prices continue \\nto outpace their salaries and wages. The prospect of owning a home in Canada \\nneeds to be as real for young people today, as it was for any other generation.  \\nAnd for the millions of Canadians who rent, including many who prefer the \\nflexibility that comes with renting, drastic rent increases have pushed what was \\nonce an affordable option out of reach. \\nCanadians need help now, and Canada will work to make homeownership a \\nreality for young Canadians and to protect renters, many of whom are \\nMillennial and Gen Z, and are paying a much higher portion of their earnings \\ntowards rents than previous generations.  \\nBudget 2024 takes action to unlock new pathways for young renters to become \\nhomeowners, and to protect middle class homeowners from rising mortgage \\npayments.

The government has taken steps to better manage \\ntemporary migration pressures while moderating the pace of its levels plan. \\nUnder the 2024–2026 Immigration Levels Plan, the government has carefully \\nmoderated the intake of new permanent residents, moving towards a long-term \\napproach that seeks to strike a balance between meeting the economic \\nimperatives and enhancing the ability of communities to effectively welcome \\nand integrate immigrants.  \\nThe government has also recently announced that it will reduce the share of \\ntemporary residents to 5 per cent of the overall population over the next three \\nyears. This will lead to approximately 600,000 fewer temporary residents in \\nCanada compared to current levels.  \\nNormalizing permanent and temporary immigration levels is critical to ensuring \\nthat newcomers have the opportunities and social supports they need to \\nsucceed when coming to Canada.  \\nFurther, these changes will ensure that newcomers, and all Canadians, have an \\naffordable place to call home. The scale of this reduction is significant in the \\ncontext of housing demand: in recent years, Canada has built about 220,000 \\nhousing units annually.   \\nThe government has also taken steps to reduce the volume of asylum claims. In \\nMarch 2023, Canada and the United States announced the expansion of the \\nSafe Third Country Agreement, which requires asylum claimants to request \\nprotection in the first safe country they arrive in, unless they qualify for an \\nexception to the Agreement. This has resulted in significantly fewer individuals \\nclaiming asylum at irregular crossings in between Canada’s land ports of entry.

By better aligning temporary \\nimmigration pressures to a moderate pace, Canada can ensure a better capacity \\nto welcome newcomers. \\nIn January 2024, the government announced a new cap on the number of study \\npermit applications, which is expected to decrease approved study permits by \\nup to 28 per cent in 2024 for the groups included under the cap. The \\ngovernment also announced new eligibility criteria for the Post-Graduation \\nWork Permit. This will help ease housing demand growth, while also protecting \\ninternational students from fraudulent institutions and unsafe living conditions.  \\nThis builds on the government’s announcement last fall to reform the \\nInternational Student Program. As committed in the 2023 Fall Economic \\nStatement, by fall 2024, the government will launch a new Recognized \\nInstitutions Framework to reward post-secondary institutions with high \\nstandards around selecting, supporting—including by providing access to \\nhousing—and retaining international students.

By alleviating student housing pressures, generations of \\nCanadians and international students today, and tomorrow, will have a more \\naffordable pathway to getting a good education. \\nCredit for Paying Rent \\nEvery month, millions of Canadian renters pay their rent in full and on-time. The \\ngovernment thinks that should count towards their credit worthiness when \\napplying for their first mortgage, seeking to refinance a mortgage and in many \\nother situations that require credit evaluations. For young Canadians and \\nnewcomers to Canada, this is even more important as they have a more difficult \\ntime establishing credit history. \\nMore Gen Z and Millennials are renting today than the generations that came \\nbefore them, with over 54 per cent of people between 25 and 34 years old \\nbeing renters—and that number jumps to 81 per cent for people under 24 \\nyears old. In comparison, 25 per cent of Canadians between 55 and 64 years old \\nare renters today. By making renters’ payments count, we can help younger \\nCanadians get ahead. \\nIn Budget 2024, the government is setting a firm expectation with lenders, \\nthrough its strengthened Canadian Mortgage Charter, to take a renter’s on-time \\npayment history into account when performing credit evaluations for mortgage \\napplications. \\n Budget 2024 announces that the government is calling on banks, fintechs, \\nand credit bureaus to prioritize launching tools to allow renters to opt-in \\nto reporting their rent payment history to credit bureaus, to strengthen \\ntheir credit scores and unlock pathways for more renters to become \\nhomeowners. \\nTogether, this ability to strengthen one’s credit score with on-time rental \\npayment history—and make it easier to qualify for a mortgage, or even a lower \\nrate—works in parallel to the government’s efforts to advance consumer-driven \\nbanking.

The \\nMortgage Charter sets an expectation for her bank to send an early notice \\ninforming her of her renewal options, which gives her plenty of time to shop \\naround for a better rate. Jessica works with a mortgage broker to evaluate her \\noptions and finds a more competitive mortgage rate at a different lender. As a \\nborrower with mortgage insurance, Jessica is able to switch lenders at renewal \\nwithout needing to requalify under the minimum qualifying rate (the stress \\ntest).  \\nBecause the Mortgage Charter helped inform Jessica that she could switch \\nlenders without another stress test, Jessica is able to reduce her mortgage rate \\nfrom 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent and save around $1,000 per year. \\nExtending amortization and not paying interest on interest \\nÉric and Maya are new parents in Québec City, Quebec who purchased their \\nfirst home two years ago.

Because the \\nMortgage Charter sets expectations for lenders to proactively contact borrowers \\nfacing mortgage hardship, Éric and Maya are able to get back to paying down \\ntheir mortgage balance and avoid about $400 in interest on interest. \\nWhen interest rates fall, the bank will work with Éric and Maya to help them return \\nto their original amortization schedule. \\n \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='74   Chapter 1 \\nHalal Mortgages \\nCanada is home to a vibrant and growing market of alternative financing \\nproducts, including halal mortgages, that enable Muslim Canadians, and other \\ndiverse communities, to further participate in the housing market.  \\n Budget 2024 announces that the government is exploring new measures \\nto expand access to alternative financing products, like halal mortgages. \\nThis could include changes in the tax treatment of these products or a \\nnew regulatory sandbox for financial service providers, while ensuring \\nadequate consumer protections are in place.  \\nIn March 2024, the government began consulting financial services providers \\nand diverse communities to understand how federal policies can better support \\nthe needs of all Canadians seeking to become homeowners. The government \\nwill provide an update in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement. \\nStrengthening Mortgage Income Verification  \\nFinancial institutions maintain rigorous policies to verify borrower income when \\ndetermining someone’s ability to repay their mortgage.

By denying income tax deductions, the \\ngovernment is removing the profit incentive for short-term rental operators. \\nSome provinces, including Quebec and British Columbia, and municipalities such \\nas Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver, have already taken action to return short-\\nterm rentals to the long-term market for Canadians to live in. To support the work \\nof municipalities to unlock homes for Canadians, the federal government is \\ncommitted to launching a $50 million short-term rental enforcement fund.

Making sure everyone has a place to live is the right thing \\nto do, and it’s the Canadian thing to do.  \\nA strong and growing community housing sector supports vulnerable people, \\nincluding those making low incomes, those fleeing violence, and those \\nexperiencing homelessness. It also keeps affordable housing affordable, builds \\nnew affordable options that meet everyone’s needs, and supports strong, \\ndiverse communities.

It’s a promise at the heart of who we \\nare, and it goes back generations.  \\nFrom universal public health care to Employment Insurance to strong, stable, \\nfunded pensions, like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), there has always been an \\nagreement that we will take care of our neighbours when they have the need. It \\ngave our workers stability, and our businesses confidence, that the right \\nsupports were in place to keep our economy fair, keep people healthy, ready, \\nand well supported, and keep the middle class strong. \\nIn 2015, the government recognized that the economy had changed. People \\nneeded more supports, and of a new kind. The government got to work. The \\nCanada Child Benefit was introduced, which has helped cut the child poverty \\nrate by more than half. The security and dignity of retirement income was \\nreinforced, by strengthening the CPP and increasing Old Age Security (OAS) for \\nseniors 75 and over. The government permanently eliminated interest on \\nfederal student and apprenticeship loans. And it made generational investments \\nin $10-a-day child care, cutting child care costs by at least half—giving families \\nmoney back in their pockets and giving children the best start in life. \\nThese have been investments in people, unprecedented in the history of \\nCanada. Consistent, reliable support has provided certainty for families in a \\ndeeply uncertain time, making sure they have the support they rely on to get \\nahead. It has meant regular monthly or quarterly benefits that help people keep \\nup with the cost of living; supports that provide stability, support that was not \\nthere nine years ago. The government has enhanced and strengthened our \\nsocial safety net for every generation. \\nThe hard work of previous generations who built Canada’s world-renowned \\npension funds built the foundation of our progress today. Canada’s social safety \\nnet needs to be there for every generation. And we are making it work for them. \\nFor young families, especially Millennial parents, who too often face high rent, \\nhigh child care costs, and worries about their child’s future, a stronger social \\nsafety net is now here. For every younger Canadian to pursue their dreams, \\nwe’re making it more affordable to get an education, save for a home, and build \\na career.  \\nBudget 2024 takes action to ensure Canada’s social safety net works for every \\ngeneration, especially Millennials and Gen Z. Transformative investments will \\ncontinue levelling the playing field and lifting up every generation.

We have made a promise to each other, as Canadians, that if \\nyou get ill or injured or are born with complicated health issues, you don’t need \\nto go into debt just to get essential care. Here in Canada, no matter where you \\nlive or what you earn, you should always be able to get the medical care \\nyou need. \\nTo maintain the core pillar of our social safety net, last year, the federal \\ngovernment announced our $200 billion ten year health care plan to clear \\nbacklogs, improve primary care, and cut wait times, delivering the health \\noutcomes that Canadians need and deserve.  \\nWhen people are healthy, our economy is healthy. Since 2015, the government \\nhas promised and delivered more. That includes ensuring access to affordable \\ndental care and prescription medications. In December, the new Canadian \\nDental Care Plan began enrollment, which is expected to support nine million \\nuninsured Canadians by 2025.  \\nIn February, the federal government introduced legislation to deliver the first \\nphase of national pharmacare to provide universal coverage for most \\ncontraceptives and many diabetes medications, in partnership with provinces \\nand territories. Pharmacare will ensure every woman can choose the birth \\ncontrol that is best for her, and that every woman, no matter how much money \\nshe has, can control her own body. \\nNow, the government’s generational transformation of Canada’s social safety \\nnet is delivering a new Canada Disability Benefit. Soon, we will begin \\nconsultations on how we can better support caregivers in their essential roles \\nupholding the health and well-being of Canadians. \\nBudget 2024 highlights new measures that will strengthen Canada’s social \\nsafety net to lift up every generation. No matter your age, your income, or your \\ncircumstances, every Canadian deserves to feel secure in the knowledge that \\nthey will get the care and support they need. Because this is what Canadians do; \\nthey take care of each other. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='Lifting Up Every Generation   89 \\nKey Ongoing Actions \\n\\uf0fc Providing nearly $200 billion over ten years to strengthen universal public \\nhealth care for Canadians, including $1.7 billion to support wage \\nincreases for personal support workers and related professions, and $5.4 \\nbillion for long-term care and home and community care to help people \\nage with dignity close to home. \\n\\uf0fc Enhancing the Canada Workers Benefit to help hard-working people with \\nfull-time, low-wage jobs support themselves and their families, by \\nproviding up to $2,739 to working families and $1,590 to single workers, \\nthrough four payments spread throughout the year. \\n\\uf0fc Rolling out the Canadian Dental Care Plan to provide dental coverage for \\nuninsured Canadians with a family income of less than $90,000.

This makes it harder to start and \\ngrow a family, and means parents—especially moms—are often not able to \\npursue their careers because of high costs and low access to child care. For too \\nmany, the cost of child care is greater than the income from returning to work. \\nNo matter how hard parents work, it feels nearly impossible to get ahead. \\nThat’s why the government launched a Canada-wide affordable child care \\nsystem in 2021. This program is saving Canadian families thousands of dollars \\nevery year. Already, eight provinces and territories have reached $10-a-day, and \\nthe rest have cut fees by 50 per cent. All provinces and territories are on track to \\noffer $10-a-day child care.  \\nAffordable child care helps more moms return to the workforce, helping our \\neconomy to reach its full potential. These supply-side investments are working. \\nIn September 2023, the labour force participation rate of prime working aged \\nwomen reached a record high of 85.7 per cent. That means more families are \\nbringing home more income. And, more people working means more economic \\ngrowth. This is good social policy and good economic policy, and it is good \\nfeminist policy. \\nBut there still aren’t enough child care spaces. We need to build more spaces to \\ngive every child the best start in life, help every family save thousands of dollars \\non child care, and ensure the next generation of parents don’t have to choose \\nbetween having a family or a career. That is why the federal government is \\nhelping build more child care spaces. \\n To launch a $1 billion Child Care Expansion Loan Program, Budget 2024 \\nproposes to provide $179.4 million over five years, starting in 2024-25, \\nwith $5.7 million in future years, to the Canada Mortgage and Housing \\nCorporation.  \\n The Child Care Expansion Loan Program will offer $1 billion in low-cost \\nloans and $60 million in non-repayable contributions to public and not-\\nfor-profit child care providers to build more child care spaces and \\nrenovate their existing child care centres.  \\n\\xad The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s expertise in \\nfinancing capital projects will result in a fast roll-out of the program, \\nand enable synergies between child care infrastructure and housing \\ndevelopment.

But saving enough isn’t easy. To help low-income families afford \\nthis, the government created the Canada Learning Bond in 2004. The Canada \\nLearning Bond provides up to $2,000—without any family contribution necessary.  \\nThe only requirement is that you enroll your child. However, many families are \\nsimply not aware that their child is entitled to these benefits, and for those who \\ndo know, the onus of enrollment can be challenging while raising a family. We \\ndon’t think it is fair that families and children are missing out on this support \\nthat they are entitled to. Every child should have all the help they can get to \\npursue a post-secondary education. \\n Budget 2024 announces the government’s intention to amend the \\nCanada Education Savings Act to introduce automatic enrolment in the \\nCanada Learning Bond for eligible children who do not have a Registered \\nEducation Savings Plan opened for them by the time the child turns four.  \\n\\xad Starting in 2028-29, all eligible children born in 2024 or later would \\nhave a Registered Education Savings Plan automatically opened for \\nthem and the eligible Canada Learning Bond payments would be \\nauto-deposited in these accounts.  \\n\\xad To ensure that all children can benefit from this simplified process, \\nstarting in 2028-29, caregivers of eligible children born before 2024 \\nwould also be able to request that Employment and Social \\nDevelopment Canada open a Registered Education Savings Plan for \\ntheir child and auto-deposit the eligible Canada Learning Bond \\npayments.  \\n\\xad This will ensure that 130,000 additional children receive the Canada \\nLearning Bond each year through automatic enrolment.    \\n Budget 2024 also announces the government’s intention to introduce \\nchanges to the Canada Education Savings Act to extend the age from 20 \\nto 30 years to retroactively claim the Canada Learning Bond. This would \\nprovide those who start their post-secondary education later to benefit \\nfrom the government’s contribution to their education savings.  \\n4 The Government of Canada has entered into an asymmetrical agreement with the province of Quebec that \\nwill allow for further improvements to its early learning and child care system, where parents with a subsidized, \\nreduced contribution space already pay a single fee of less than $10-a-day. \\n5 This amount is indexed and may increase with inflation or the growth rate of the cost of subsidized spaces. \\nParents of children in non-subsidized spaces are entitled to a refundable tax credit for child care expenses \\ncovering between 67-78 per cent of all expenses paid, depending on family income, with a maximum eligible \\nexpense of $43 per day in 2023.

To ensure this support keeps up with the cost of an \\neducation, the government permanently increased Canada Student Grants by \\n50 per cent to $3,000 dollars. In 2020, when students faced challenges finding \\nwork and affording school, the government temporarily doubled Canada \\nStudent Grants to provide $6,000 each year for three school years. \\nEven with increases in financial supports for students, and the permanent \\nelimination of interest on student loans, many students still need more support \\nto cover rising costs.

One way to do this is to encourage younger generations to \\nrelocate to rural and remote communities, where homes are often cheaper than \\nour biggest cities, and where professionals in health care and social services are \\nneeded. The government already encourages doctors and nurses to move to \\nrural and remote communities by offering student loan forgiveness.

The government’s largest program, Old Age Security, is projected \\nto deliver $80.6 billion to more than seven million seniors this year—\\nsignificantly reducing seniors’ poverty. The Canada Pension Plan is a bedrock of \\na secure retirement, providing an average of $8,400 every year to nearly 6 \\nmillion retirees.  \\nThe golden years are meant to be spent enjoying the fruits of a lifetime of hard \\nwork. That’s why, in 2016, the government reversed the previous government’s \\ndecision to delay OAS and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) benefits to \\nseniors from age 65 to 67.  \\nSince 2015, the government has increased the pensions and benefits seniors \\nreceive. Doing so has helped to reduce seniors’ poverty, with about 11,000 seniors \\nthat have been lifted out of poverty since 2015, and the proportion of seniors \\nliving in poverty decreased from 7.1 per cent in 2015, to 5.6 per cent in 2021. \\nThe government’s unprecedented support for seniors means that, of all age \\ncohorts, seniors are the least likely to live in poverty today. But it wasn’t always \\nthis way. In 1976, seniors had the highest poverty rate of any age cohort at that \\ntime. To uphold this progress, we are protecting seniors’ benefits and \\nstrengthening their pensions. \\nTo ensure seniors have access to the care they deserve, the government also will \\nintroduce a Safe Long Term Care Act to ensure that seniors have the care they \\ndeserve, no matter where they live.

It doesn’t have to be this way. \\nWhether enabling young people to save more of their money for an education \\nor first home, or helping families to make ends meet, the government is \\nfighting to help Canadians keep more of their money.  \\nTo do this, the government is taking action to hold to account those who are \\ncharging Canadians unnecessarily high prices, whether it is grocers inflating \\ntheir profit margins, corporations charging junk fees, or unnecessary banking \\nfees. This budget will help ensure that corporations aren’t taking advantage of \\nCanadians and will make sure the economy is fair, affordable, and set up to \\nmake it easier to get a good deal.  \\nBudget 2024 builds on these efforts and gives people back control over their \\npersonal finances and banking choices, with action to cap banking fees and give \\nCanadians better access to digital banking, lower-cost accounts, and stronger \\nconsumer protection.  \\n3.1 Affordable Groceries \\nThe government is taking action to lower the cost of groceries and make life \\nmore affordable.  \\nThe cost pressures Canadians are facing start with the price of food.

Local food \\nprograms enable communities to grow, process, store, and distribute food to \\nthose in need within the community, improving the availability of and access to \\nnutritious, local food and reducing the need to shop at major grocery chains.  \\nPeople should be able to grow food in their communities. It helps them save \\nmoney on groceries, and it helps them build stronger connections with their \\ncommunities. For children, an understanding of where food comes from is best \\nlearned by growing it in their own neighbourhood.

Farmers should be \\nable to use the costly equipment they purchase however it is needed to run \\ntheir farm. \\nWhen farmers have to purchase new, more expensive equipment to grow our \\nfood, it can drive up their costs, which get passed on at the checkout. Helping \\nfarmers keep costs low is a key component of ensuring the sustainability of our \\nfood supply chains.

These \\nchanges have supported over 10,000 farmers with the increased costs for \\nagricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and fuel, triggered by Russia’s illegal war \\nagainst Ukraine, global supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $64 million in 2024-25 to Agriculture \\nand Agri-Food Canada to support a $250,000 interest-free limit on \\nAdvance Payments Program loans for the 2024 program year.

The intensifying \\neffects of climate change are particularly wreaking havoc on farmers’ abilities to \\nearn a stable income, and to contribute to our food security. \\nThe Livestock Tax Deferral serves as crucial instrument for the government in \\nmitigating the financial burden on farmers during natural disasters, such as \\ndrought or floods. This reliable, predictable support helps farmers build \\nresilience as they face the increasingly severe effects of climate change. \\nThe federal government is committed to working with industry partners, such as \\nthe Canadian Cattle Association, to explore avenues to ensure farmers get \\nsupport quicker and more efficiently in times of need.  \\n3.2 Fairer Prices, Fewer Fees \\nNo one likes surprise fees. But it seems that every day, Canadians are paying \\nextra fees over and above base prices, such as checked and carry-on baggage \\nfees or international roaming charges. These extra fees are on top of what \\nCanadians already paid for their airline ticket and monthly phone plan. \\nTransparency on all fees up-front is essential so that businesses do not \\ndeceptively advertise lower prices than what Canadians will actually pay.  \\nJunk fees are their own source of frustration. From high service fees or charges, \\nto surprise event ticketing fees, to non-sufficient funds and transaction fees \\ncharged by banks, these costs add up. And, they disproportionately impact \\nlower- and middle-income Canadians. The federal government is taking action \\nto cut junk fees everywhere it can, and is launching a call to action to provinces \\nand territories to reduce the junk fees under their jurisdiction.

The federal government is using all legislative and regulatory \\nlevers at its disposal to reduce the unnecessary fees Canadians pay, including \\nthrough reforming competition law, directing federal agencies to strengthen \\nprotections for Canadians, and introducing new caps to reduce bank fees. The \\nfederal government is making significant progress to deliver on its \\ncommitments to crack down on junk fees: \\n1. Amending the Competition Act to strengthen protections against \\nhidden prices: Through Bill C-59, the government is further cracking down \\non drip pricing (when additional charges or fees affect consumers’ abilities \\nto make informed decisions about prices) by strengthening prohibitions \\nagainst the digital marketing of unattainable prices without the inclusion of \\nmandatory fees. The proposed amendments will also enable Canadians to \\nbring deceptive marketing claims directly to the Competition Tribunal.

Directing the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications \\nCommission (CRTC) to improve competition and support consumers: \\nLast year, the government issued a new directive to put in place new rules \\nand improve competition in the telecom sector to protect Canadians from \\nunfair businesses practices and to lower prices. In the time since, the CRTC \\nhas already increased choice and affordability of high-speed internet \\nservices for more than five million Canadian families by requiring large \\ntelecom companies to provide competitors with access to their fibre optic \\nnetworks.  \\n3. Introducing the Financial Consumer Protection Framework \\nRegulations to help Canadians avoid fees: Since June 2022, updated \\nregulations have helped Canadians avoid non-sufficient funds fees by \\nrequiring banks to send Canadians electronic alerts when their chequing or \\nsavings account, or credit card or line of credit balance falls below $100, \\nand allow Canadians to set a different amount; and requiring advance \\nnotice before renewal of products or services to ensure you only pay for \\nthe services you need. \\n4. Amending the Air Passenger Protection Regulations: To ensure that \\nairlines seat all children under the age of 14 next to their accompanying \\nadult at no extra cost, the government is developing regulatory \\namendments, which will be introduced this year. The government is also \\ntaking further action to strengthen transparency of optional fees charged \\nby airlines, for everything from baggage to seat selection to in-flight meals. \\nIn addition to delivering on previous commitments, the federal government is \\ntaking further action to help Canadians avoid junk fees wherever possible. \\nCheaper Internet, Home Phone, and Cell Phone Plans  \\nCanadians who want to switch to a cheaper internet or phone plan often \\nencounter discouraging practices from telecom companies, such as cancellation \\nfees which can prevent Canadians from saving money, or making them wait on \\nthe phone for hours to speak with customer service. Canadians can also face \\nthe end of promotional periods, and higher monthly bills without full awareness \\nof their options. \\nWhether travelling abroad, changing your phone number, or being late on a \\npayment, the extra fees charged by telecom companies add up, too. Canadians \\nneed to be aware of the potential junk fees they could face, and companies \\nneed to lower these fees to ensure Canadians can accurately plan how much \\ntheir cell phone and other telecom services will cost them. \\nAll Canadians should be able to access these essential services at affordable prices.

This requires \\nCanadians to share their banking credentials with fintech companies.  \\nWith consumer-driven banking, fintechs will be able to offer Canadians a way to \\nsecurely share select data with the fintech tools of their choice—without sharing \\naccess to their bank account. The potential of consumer-driven banking \\nincludes new apps and tools to help Canadians’ better keep track of bills, track a \\nbudget, collect and compare information to allow for better decisions when \\nexchanging currencies or investing in the stock market, secure a loan, find a \\nbetter deal on insurance, or track monthly rent payments to build up credit \\nscores. These innovations can help make life more affordable, and even help \\nyoung Canadians when it is time to buy a first home. \\nBefore these new financial tools can become available, Canada needs a \\nframework that makes sure this technology is secure for Canadians and that \\neliminates the risky practice of screen scraping. \\nTo drive an innovative consumer-driven banking ecosystem in Canada, the 2023 \\nFall Economic Statement announced that the federal government would \\nintroduce legislation to establish Canada’s Consumer-Driven Banking \\nFramework. This Framework will regulate access to financial data, providing \\nCanadians and small businesses with safe and secure access to financial services \\nand products that help them manage and improve their finances. \\n Budget 2024 announces that the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada \\n(FCAC) will be mandated to oversee, administer, and enforce Canada’s \\nConsumer-Driven Banking Framework. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $1 million in 2024-2025 for FCAC to \\nsupport preparation for its new responsibilities and to begin development \\nof a consumer awareness campaign. The FCAC will transition to a full \\ncost-recovery basis once the framework is in place.  \\n Budget 2024 also proposes to provide $4.1 million over three years \\nstarting in 2024-25 for the Department of Finance to complete policy \\nwork necessary to establish and maintain a consumer-driven banking \\noversight entity and framework, including the implementation of a \\nnational security regime.

Tools that enable Canadians to use \\nconfirmation of timely rental payments to build a credit score are an example.  \\n \\n \\n  \\nNew tools coming to help you manage your subscriptions \\nTo keep track of recurring bills and subscriptions, a consumer-driven banking \\nsystem would provide Canadians secure access to services that would enable \\nthem to easily track payments and monitor subscriptions in one place.

Many Canadians in \\ndifficult financial circumstances have benefitted from financial help services that \\nprovide advice and options. More of these services are needed to ensure all \\nvulnerable people, especially those with low incomes, have access to the tools \\nand information they need to achieve financial security. National charities, like \\nProsper Canada, provide these services, with a focus on expanding economic \\nopportunity and economic empowerment for every Canadian. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $60 million over five years, starting in \\n2024-25, to Prosper Canada to expand the community-delivered financial \\nhelp services available to Canadians. These enhanced services are \\nexpected to reach one million low- to moderate-income Canadians over \\nfive years, helping them receive nearly $2 billion in unclaimed tax and \\nbenefit income. \\nThis support will enable Prosper Canada, working with community organization \\npartners, to expand free programming and free advice services. These free \\nprograms help Canadians do their taxes and find the benefits they are entitled \\nto, find affordable ways to build their savings, and improve their financial \\nsituations so they can get ahead. As announced in Chapter 8, the government is \\nalso advancing automatic tax filing to help more Canadians easily receive the \\nbenefits to which they are entitled. \\nDoing More to Crack Down on Predatory Lending   \\nPredatory lenders can take advantage of the most vulnerable Canadians in our \\ncommunities. Predatory loans, including high-interest installment loans, are a \\nfast growing and widely held type of debt in Canada, and are disproportionately \\naccessed by low-income Canadians, newcomers, and those with limited credit \\nhistory. Some consumer groups have indicated that lenders often refinance \\nhigh-cost loans to keep borrowers in a cycle of debt.  \\nTo protect financially at-risk Canadians, in Budget 2023, the government \\ncommitted to lowering the criminal rate of interest, from the equivalent of 48 \\nper cent APR to 35 per cent APR, following Quebec in setting the lowest \\nmaximum interest rate in Canada. The government also committed to limit the \\ncosts of payday loans to no more than $14 per $100 borrowed. The \\ngovernment is reinforcing its efforts to crack down on predatory lending, and \\nmoving forward with these reforms to protect Canadians on a priority basis. \\nTo further protect the most financially at-risk Canadians, the government is \\ngoing further to lower borrowing costs, limit the risk of harmful debt cycles, and \\nhelp Canadians keep more of their money in their pockets.

The \\nclean tech fund will manage equity investments into innovative \\nentrepreneurs and businesses that are creating good-paying jobs and \\naccelerating the energy transition.  \\nCarbon Contracts for Difference \\nA price on pollution is the foundation of Canada’s plan to build a prosperous \\nnet-zero economy. It is a system that is fair and that promotes market-driven \\nsolutions. The government recognizes the substantial demand from industry and \\nother stakeholders for carbon contracts for difference (CCFDs) as a tool to \\naccelerate investment in decarbonization and clean growth technologies by \\nproviding certainty around carbon pricing. \\nThe 2023 Fall Economic Statement announced that the Canada Growth Fund will \\nbe the principal federal entity to issue CCFDs, including allocating, on a priority \\nbasis, up to $7 billion to issue all forms of contracts for difference and offtake \\nagreements. The Canada Growth Fund is fulfilling this important role as a federal \\nissuer of CCFDs. Building on its initial success, the Canada Growth Fund is \\nassessing the opportunity to expand its carbon contract offerings and is \\ndeveloping approaches that can best serve the different carbon credit markets \\nacross Canada: \\n Budget 2024 announces that the Canada Growth Fund is developing an \\nexpanded range of CCFD offerings tailored to different markets and their \\nunique risks and opportunities. The Canada Growth Fund will continue \\noffering bespoke CCFDs and carbon offtake agreements, with a focus on \\nprovinces contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emissions \\nreductions. \\n Building on the insights gained from these transactions, Budget 2024 \\nannounces the Canada Growth Fund will explore ways to broaden its \\napproach, for example, by developing off-the-shelf contracts for certain \\njurisdictions and ways to offer these contracts on a competitive basis for a \\nset amount of emissions reductions. \\n The Canada Growth Fund has around $6 billion remaining to continue \\nissuing, on a priority basis, all forms of CCFDs and carbon offtake \\nagreements. Budget 2024 announces the government will ensure that the \\nCanada Growth Fund continues to have the resources it needs to fulfill its \\nrole as federal issuer of CCFDs. The government is also evaluating options \\nto enhance the Canada Growth Fund’s capacity to offer CCFDs, including \\nby exploring the possibility of a government backstop of certain CCFD \\nliabilities of the Canada Growth Fund.

For example, in 2022, \\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada worked with Alberta to ensure that \\ntheir TIER market was sufficiently stringent so that the projected demand for \\ncarbon credits exceeded projected supply, ensuring robust credit demand even \\nas more major decarbonization projects get built and more credits are \\ngenerated.  \\nCredit markets are largely the responsibility of provinces, and there are \\nopportunities to improve how these markets function. For example, \\ncommitments to maintain their industrial carbon pricing systems over the \\nlong-term, tighten the stringency of systems as necessary to avoid an \\noversupply of credits, publishing the price of carbon credits, and recommitting \\nto maintain a price signal of $170 per tonne by 2030 could help improve \\ncarbon price expectations for investors. Increased credit price transparency \\nwould greatly improve market functioning and provide greater investment \\ncertainty, unlocking more decarbonization projects. It would also facilitate the \\nCanada Growth Fund’s efforts to develop off-the-shelf CCFDs and deliver \\nmore deals, much quicker across provincial carbon markets.  \\n Budget 2024 announces that Environment and Climate Change Canada will \\nwork with provinces and territories to improve the functioning of carbon \\ncredit markets, in order to help unlock additional decarbonization projects \\nthroughout Canada. \\nGetting Major Projects Done  \\nPutting Canada on a path to net-zero requires significant and sustained private \\nsector investment in clean electricity, critical minerals, and other major projects. \\nFor these investments to be made, Canada’s regulatory system must be efficient \\nand quicker—it shouldn’t take over a decade to open a new mine and secure \\nour critical minerals supply chains.  \\nTo that end, Budget 2023 announced an intention to develop a plan to improve \\nthe efficiency of the impact assessment and permitting processes for major \\nprojects. The Ministerial Working Group on Regulatory Efficiency for Clean \\nGrowth Projects was launched to coordinate this work, and drive positive, pro-\\ngrowth culture change throughout government, to ensure major project \\napprovals come quicker. New major projects create thousands of new, good-\\npaying jobs for Canadians, and the government is focused on getting \\nmore done.

It is \\nessential that these businesses thrive so they can continue being the bedrock of \\nour communities and our economy. \\nPollution has a cost, one which will only rise this century as climate change causes \\nintensifying natural disasters and more severe health effects, as detailed in Chapter \\n5. Canada’s carbon pricing system includes a federal backstop for provinces and \\nterritories that don’t put their own system in place. It’s a system designed to be fair \\nand affordable—for households, Indigenous communities, farmers, and \\nbusinesses—while reducing the pollution that is causing climate change. \\nThe government is delivering on its commitment to return proceeds from the \\nprice on pollution to small- and medium-sized businesses, by announcing an \\naccelerated and automated return process to provide direct refunds to small- \\nand medium-sized businesses in the provinces where the federal fuel charge \\napplies—the new Canada Carbon Rebate for Small Businesses. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to urgently return fuel charge proceeds from 2019-\\n20 through 2023-24 to an estimated 600,000 businesses, with 499 or fewer \\nemployees through a new refundable tax credit. This would deliver over \\n$2.5 billion directly to Canada’s small- and medium-sized businesses. \\n\\xad Proceeds would be returned directly to eligible corporations through \\ndirect payments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), separately \\nfrom CRA tax refunds. \\n\\xad To receive their proceed return for each fuel charge year, corporations \\nwould be required to have filed their tax return for 2023 by July 15, 2024. \\n\\xad The proposal would return proceeds for future fuel charge years, \\nincluding 2024-25, in a similar manner each year. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 215}, page_content='202   Chapter 4 \\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada continues to consult with Indigenous \\ngovernments on how best to directly return fuel charge proceeds to their \\ncommunities, and will announce next steps soon. The share of fuel charge \\nproceeds allocated to Indigenous governments will double to 2 per cent of \\ndirect proceeds beginning this year. \\nUnlocking New Opportunity Through Financial \\nCrown Corporations  \\nCanada’s financial Crown corporations support economic growth by helping \\nbusinesses get the financing they need to grow; helping farmers and agri-\\nbusinesses invest in new equipment and technology and support their \\noperations; and helping companies sell their products around the world.  \\nCanadians expect the government to make the most of their tax dollars. That is \\nwhy in the 2023 Fall Economic Statement the government announced it would \\nbe reviewing the operations of the Business Development Bank of Canada, \\nExport Development Canada, and Farm Credit Canada. Based on this review: \\n Budget 2024 announces changes to the Capital and Dividend Policy \\nFramework for Financial Crown Corporations in order to increase the focus \\non output-based metrics such as economic growth and to ensure that \\nfinancial Crown corporations follow best practices of peer organizations in \\nsimilar international jurisdictions, not private sector actors.  \\n\\xad The amended Framework has also introduced a target solvency rating \\nfor financial Crown corporations in cases where the Office of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions has no legislative supervisory \\nrole. The amended Framework can be found in the: Capital and \\nDividend Policy Framework for Financial Crown Corporations.  \\n Budget 2024 announces new guidance to these institutions to mobilize \\nmore financing, and take on greater risk, in order to get more support to \\nthe Canadian businesses that need it. In addition to this overarching \\nguidance, Budget 2024 identifies specific new areas for these Crown \\ncorporations to focus on: \\n\\xad The Business Development Bank of Canada should increase \\nfinancing for promising new and high-growth businesses and \\naccelerate reorientation of its venture capital investments toward \\nemerging and higher-risk sectors to help attract more private capital. \\n\\xad Export Development Canada should leverage its full toolkit and \\nauthorities, including by updating internal risk management guidance \\nto facilitate greater risk taking across its portfolio. Recognizing that \\nsuccess for Canadian exporters in highly competitive markets and \\nsectors at times requires additional targeted support, Export \\nDevelopment Canada should also create a new stretch capital '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 216}, page_content='Economic Growth for Every Generation    203 \\nenvelope to maximize potential for exporters in areas of strategic \\nimportance for Canada by taking on greater risk in deploying its \\ncapital. Having Export Development Canada take on more higher-risk, \\nhigher-impact transactions itself will reduce the need for direct \\nsupport through the Canada Account. Further implementation details, \\nincluding the scale and scope of the envelope, will be identified over \\nthe coming months. \\n\\xad Farm Credit Canada should continue to pursue opportunities to \\nsupport agri-food and agribusiness, including through venture capital \\ninvestment, and further deployment of technologies to mitigate \\nclimate change. The government intends to amend the Farm Credit \\nCanada Act to require regular legislative reviews that ensure Farm \\nCredit Canada’s activities are aligned with the sector’s needs. \\nIn focusing their mandate on driving economic growth and productivity, these \\nCrown corporations are also expected to prioritize new financing, insurance, and \\nadvisory support to under-financed business owners, as well as increase their \\npublic reporting and engagement with Canadians. The performance incentives of \\nsenior leaders are expected to align with their organizations taking on increased \\nrisk appetite in support of economic growth objectives. For Export Development \\nCanada, performance incentives should also encourage alignment of business \\nactivities with countries that have free trade agreements with Canada.  \\nInvesting in Canadian Start-Ups  \\nVenture capital financing gives Canadian entrepreneurs the resources they need \\nto start-up, scale-up, and become the next generation of Canadian anchor \\ncompanies. Financing can help take new ideas from lab to market, while \\ncreating high-quality, middle-class jobs.  \\nThe Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative (VCCI) strengthens Canada’s venture \\ncapital ecosystem by co-investing with the private market, discovering and \\nnurturing the next generation of globally recognized Canadian companies, and \\ngenerating returns for private and public investors alike. Since 2016, the \\ngovernment has invested $821 million through VCCI, delivering support to over \\n300 companies across Canada.  \\n Building on this momentum, Budget 2024 proposes to provide $200 million \\nover two years, starting 2026-27, on a cash basis, to increase access to \\nventure capital for equity-deserving entrepreneurs, and to invest in \\nunderserved communities and outside key metropolitan hubs.   \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 217}, page_content='204   Chapter 4 \\nEncouraging Pension Funds to Invest in Canada  \\nKeeping Canada’s vibrant economy strong for future generations of Canadians \\nrequires significant capital investments in our businesses, industries, and \\ncommunities. Attracting higher levels of investment into Canada from all sources, \\nincluding foreign and domestic private and institutional investors will raise \\nCanada’s productivity and increase living standards for all Canadians.  \\nPension plans are a critical pillar in Canada’s retirement income system that \\nensures Canadians can enjoy a secure and dignified retirement. Canadian pension \\nfunds hold over $3 trillion in assets, which are invested both at home and abroad \\nto provide secure retirement income for plan members and retirees.  \\nThe government believes that encouraging pension funds to invest in Canada \\nmore would help grow the Canadian economy and provide the stable long-term \\nreturns needed to deliver strong pensions for Canadians. In the 2023 Fall \\nEconomic Statement, the government committed to improving transparency \\naround pension funds’ investments and to working collaboratively with Canadian \\npension funds to create an environment that encourages and identifies more \\ndomestic investment opportunities for pension funds and other responsible \\ninstitutional investors. \\nCanadian pension funds rely on their strong governance practices and \\ndiversified portfolios to deliver Canadians’ pensions, with assets including public \\nand private equity, infrastructure, real estate, and bonds. Canada’s own \\neconomy is full of investment opportunities in these asset classes that could \\nprovide valuable contributions to pension fund portfolios. Opening up more \\nopportunities for investment by pension funds in these domestic assets would \\nhelp one of Canada’s largest pools of savings contribute to the growth of the \\nCanadian economy.  \\nFurther engagement with industry experts and pension funds will guide the \\ngovernment’s way forward on ways to make more domestic investments available \\nthat meet the needs of pension funds. \\n Budget 2024 announces the government, working with pension plans, will \\ncreate a working group, led by Stephen Poloz (former Governor of the \\nBank of Canada), and supported by the Deputy Prime Minister and \\nMinister of Finance, to explore how to catalyze greater domestic \\ninvestment opportunities for Canadian pension funds. This working group \\nwill identify priority investment opportunities that will grow Canadians’ \\npension savings – that meet Canadian pension plans’ fiduciary and \\nactuarial responsibility, spur innovation, and drive economic growth. Its \\nefforts will focus on areas, such as: \\n\\xad digital infrastructure and AI investment; \\n\\xad physical infrastructure; '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 218}, page_content=\"Economic Growth for Every Generation    205 \\n\\xad airport facilities; \\n\\xad venture capital investments; \\n\\xad building more homes, including on public lands; and, \\n\\xad the removal of the 30 per cent rule for domestic investments. \\nTo support investments in airport facilities, the Minister of Transport will release \\na policy statement this summer that highlights existing flexibilities under the \\ngovernance model for Canada’s National Airport System airports to attract \\ncapital, including from pension funds. \\n Following up on the 2023 Fall Economic Statement, Budget 2024 also \\nproposes to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 to enable \\nand require the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to \\npublicly release information related to the plan investments of large \\nfederally regulated pension plans.  \\nThe information to be disclosed would be set out in regulations and would \\ninclude the distribution of plan investments by jurisdiction and, within each \\njurisdiction, by asset class.  \\nThe government will continue to engage with provinces and territories to \\ndiscuss similar disclosures by Canada's largest pension plans in a simple and \\nuniform format. \\nBoosting Regional Economic Growth  \\nTo build a brighter future for communities across the country, Canada’s Regional \\nDevelopment Agencies help businesses and innovators grow to fuel economic \\ngrowth and create good middle class jobs. Through the Regional Economic \\nGrowth through Innovation program, businesses can access funding to scale-up, \\nimplement new technologies, improve productivity, and find new markets, \\nhelping to develop prosperous and inclusive communities across the country.  \\n To create jobs and boost regional economic growth, Budget 2024 proposes \\nto provide an additional $158.5 million over two years, starting in 2024-25, \\non a cash basis, to Canada’s Regional Development Agencies for the \\nRegional Economic Growth through Innovation program. A portion of this \\nfunding will be dedicated to housing innovation.  \\nThis support builds on the $200 million that Regional Development Agencies \\nwill deliver to businesses for AI adoption. \\n  \"), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 219}, page_content='206   Chapter 4 \\nCutting Red Tape to Boost Innovation  \\nFor innovative businesses to scale-up new ideas, they need certainty that they \\nwill be able to bring their product to market. But existing regulation can often \\nbe too outdated to fit the needs of new technologies.  \\nTo ensure regulation keeps pace with the speed of new innovations, rather than \\nhold innovation back, the government is advancing work on regulatory \\n“sandboxes” to create temporary rules to enable testing of products, services, or \\nnew regulatory approaches.  \\n Budget 2024 announces the government’s intent to introduce amendments \\nto the Red Tape Reduction Act to broaden the use of regulatory sandboxes \\nacross government. The changes will enable innovation by offering limited \\nexemptions to existing legislation and regulations, streamlining the \\nregulatory system, and reforming regulations to modern business realities. \\nSupporting the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s \\nBusiness Data Lab  \\nSince 2022, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce has collaborated with Statistics \\nCanada to provide Canadian businesses with insights and information through \\nthe Business Data Lab. This initiative provides access to real-time information \\nand analysis, that helps Canadian businesses stay informed, and make decisions \\nthat help them stay strong and support workers.  \\n To advance this work, Budget 2024 proposes to provide $7.2 million over \\nthree years, starting in 2024-25, to support the Canadian Chamber of \\nCommerce’s Business Data Lab.    \\n4.4 A Strong Workforce for a Strong Economy   \\nBuilding an economy that is fair for everyone means making sure that every \\ngeneration can seize the opportunities of the government’s investments to \\ngrow the economy and create jobs. \\nInvesting in new jobs and skills support for younger Canadians will help them \\nget that first good job or start their first business.

Recreation facilities help people build \\nhealthier lives, improving well-being and longevity. Libraries build literacy and \\nlearning, especially for young minds, and provide internet access for people \\nwith low incomes who can’t afford it at home. \\nThe Green and Inclusive Community Buildings program is providing $1.5 billion \\nto support green and accessible retrofits and upgrades of existing public \\ncommunity facilities, as well as the construction of new publicly-accessible \\ncommunity facilities across Canada.  \\nThe program is investing in projects like the retrofit of the Connections Early \\nYears Family Centre in Windsor to make it more accessible and energy efficient, \\nand an upgraded, energy efficient Band Office and daycare facility in Kapawe’no \\nFirst Nation in Alberta. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $500 million over five years, starting in \\n2024-25, to Infrastructure Canada to support more projects through the \\nGreen and Inclusive Community Buildings program. \\nInvesting in Passenger Rail Across Canada \\nCanadians are increasingly switching to clean transportation options, and taking \\nthe train is one of the most environmentally friendly ways to travel across our \\ncountry. And, taking the train is often the only means of surface transportation \\nfor rural, remote, and Indigenous communities such as Churchill, Manitoba; \\nCollins, Ontario; and Schefferville, Quebec.  \\nBudget 2024 proposes to provide: \\n $462.4 million over five years, starting in 2024-25, with $120.7 million in \\nremaining amortization, for VIA Rail network operations; \\n New funding for VIA Rail to replace its aging fleet on routes outside the \\nQuebec City-Windsor corridor. Funding amounts are not being released \\nto protect the government’s negotiating position for an upcoming \\nprocurement; and, \\n $63.1 million over three years, starting in 2024-25, for Transport Canada \\nto renew the Remote Passenger Rail Program, which supports \\nIndigenous-owned rail operators providing services to communities in \\nManitoba, Quebec, and Labrador. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 270}, page_content='Safer, Healthier Communities   257 \\nAdvancing High Frequency Rail  \\nCanada’s busiest passenger railway is between Quebec City and Toronto, home \\nto nearly half of Canada’s population—and the region is only expected to grow. \\nBut increasing congestion and travel delays are making it harder to get between \\nmajor cities in Ontario and Quebec.  \\nIncreasing rail passenger traffic is a key step towards reducing air travel \\ncongestion and delays, while also lowering emissions. Rail service must be \\nquicker and more convenient to encourage more Canadians to take the train. \\nIn 2022, the government created a new Crown corporation, VIA HFR-VIA TGF Inc., to \\nlead the development and implementation of a potential high frequency rail project \\nbetween Quebec City and Toronto. In October 2023, the government launched a \\nrequest for proposals to further design and develop the potential project, which \\ncould be one of the largest Canadian infrastructure projects in generations.  \\n Budget 2024 announces the government’s intent to introduce legislative \\namendments to make VIA HFR-VIA TGF Inc. an Agent of the Crown, \\nenabling VIA HFR-VIA TGF Inc. to deliver high frequency rail on behalf of \\nthe government.   \\n Budget 2024 also proposes to provide $371.8 million over six years, \\nstarting in 2024-25, to VIA HFR-VIA TGF Inc. and Infrastructure Canada to \\nadvance design and development of high frequency rail. \\nThe government will release further details on high frequency rail upon the \\ncompletion of the request for proposals.  \\nSmall Craft Harbours  \\nFrom the Atlantic shores of Newfoundland and Labrador to the Arctic Ocean in \\nNunavut to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, small craft harbours are at the \\nheart of Canada’s coastal communities. They are vital to fish harvesters from coast \\nto coast to coast, and support tourism and safe access to our waterways for \\neveryone.  \\nMany harbours are in need of repairs, both because of regular wear and tear, \\nand due to the extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and \\nsevere with climate change. For instance, harbours across Atlantic Canada and \\nEastern Quebec suffered significant damage from Hurricane Fiona in 2022. \\n Budget 2024 proposes to provide $463.3 million over three years, starting in \\n2024-25, on a cash basis, to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to repair and \\nmaintain small craft harbours, including those damaged by Hurricane Fiona. \\nThis investment will support local economic development for generations to \\ncome, particularly benefitting Canadians working in the fisheries, \\naquaculture, tourism, construction, and marine engineering sectors.

This is true no more so than in Atlantic Canada, \\nwhere many communities and businesses rely on bridges and ferry services for \\ntransportation. \\nThe federal government supports key transportation services in Atlantic Canada \\nthrough Marine Atlantic Inc., a Crown corporation that provides ferry service \\nbetween Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, and the Ferry Services \\nContribution Program, which funds ferry service between New Brunswick, Nova \\nScotia, Prince Edward Island, and Eastern Quebec. The federal government is \\nalso responsible for the Confederation Bridge connecting Prince Edward Island \\nand New Brunswick, which is managed through an agreement with a third-party \\nbridge operator.  \\nThrough Budget 2024, the government is taking action to ensure that these \\nservices can reliably and affordably connect Atlantic Canadians and their \\ncommunities.

The federal \\ngovernment continues to prioritize its responsibility to help ensure First \\nNations, Inuit, and Métis communities have what they need to grow and \\nsucceed on their own terms. \\nIn 2015, the federal government made a commitment to chart a new path of \\nreconciliation with Indigenous Peoples. Based on the recognition of rights, \\nrespect, and partnerships, true reconciliation brings with it the opportunity for \\nall people in Canada to know ourselves and our collective histories better. \\nReconciliation starts with renewed Nation-to-Nation, Government-to-\\nGovernment, and Inuit-Crown relationships and strengthening partnerships with \\nrights holders. \\n\\uf0fc In 2017, the Crown and Inuit partners established the Inuit-Crown \\nPartnership Committee through the Inuit Nunangat Declaration on Inuit-\\nCrown Partnership. The committee serves as the primary mechanism for \\nadvancing reconciliation between Inuit and the Crown, where significant \\nInuit-Crown priorities have advanced, including the Inuit Nunangat Policy \\nand Inuit-specific investments. \\n\\uf0fc In 2017, the federal government and Métis partners established the Métis \\nPermanent Bilateral Mechanism. This process has resulted in better policy \\nand informed investments into Métis communities. \\n\\uf0fc In 2017, the federal government and First Nation partners established the \\nAssembly of First Nations Permanent Bilateral Mechanism. This committee \\nstrengthened a whole of government focus to investing in First Nations led \\napproaches. \\n\\uf0fc In 2023, the federal government held its inaugural meeting of the Self-\\nGoverning and Modern Treaty Intergovernmental Leaders’ Forum to \\nadvance the work to uphold the spirit and intent of Treaties. \\nIn addition, Parliament passed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \\nIndigenous Peoples Act. Together, the federal government and Indigenous \\npartners co-developed the resulting inaugural five-year Action Plan to provide a \\nroadmap for the work towards increased self-determination and rights \\nrecognition for Indigenous Peoples in Canada. \\nThrough long-term investments, the federal government and Indigenous \\npartners are working to foster strong, healthy, and prosperous Indigenous \\ncommunities for generations to come.

Due to the legacy of colonialism, Indigenous Peoples \\nface their own unique challenges when it comes to mental health and well-\\nbeing, which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use, and \\ndepression.  \\nA high proportion of Indigenous youth are diagnosed with mood and anxiety \\ndisorders, as well as chronic health conditions. First Nations youth living on \\nreserve reported low mental health nearly twice as often as non-Indigenous \\nyouth. Indigenous youth struggle to access health care due to long \\ntransportation times and costs from missing school or work. \\nSupporting Indigenous people’s access to mental health doesn’t just mean \\nincreasing access to care, it also means ensuring services respect, value, and use \\ncultural knowledge, approaches, languages, and ways of knowing.

Nutrition North Canada makes \\nnutritious foods more accessible and affordable in communities without supply \\ncentres. At a time of global food price inflation, it is more important than ever \\nthat this support be there. \\nTo deliver more of this important support to advance food security and \\naffordability in the North, Budget 2024 proposes to provide:  \\n $23.2 million in 2024-25, to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern \\nAffairs Canada for Nutrition North Canada’s subsidy program to lower \\nthe cost of nutritious food and other essential household items; and,  \\n $101.1 million over three years starting in 2024-25, to support the \\nHarvesters Support Grant and Community Food Program Fund and \\npromote Indigenous communities in implementing culturally \\nappropriate, local solutions to address food insecurity. \\nNutrition North Canada is funded by the federal government and provides \\naccess to nutritious foods for 125 northern communities. Its work supports the  \\nInuit Nunangat Food Security Strategy, which prioritizes local food production \\nand community food programs.  \\nThese investments have already helped communities in Inuit Nunangat, as well \\nas other Indigenous communities, purchase equipment for harvesting, hunting, \\nand food storage, which means they are able to share meals prepared with \\ntraditional foods and have greater food security.  \\nStrengthening Access to Culturally Important Foods  \\nIndigenous Peoples suffer higher rates of food insecurity than the rest of \\nCanada.

The \\nfederal government is committed to doing this work with Indigenous \\ncommunities to ensure a brighter, safer future. Budget 2024 takes action to \\nstrengthen Indigenous oversight and development of policing.  \\nWith Indigenous communities often located in remote areas, where there is a \\nhigher risk of natural disasters, it is essential to invest in their emergency \\nmanagement response and recovery resources. The legacy of colonialism has \\nmeant that Indigenous emergency response resources have been underfunded, \\nand are ill-equipped to fight wildfires and other disasters, which are becoming \\nmore frequent and intense due to climate change. \\nBudget 2024 is investing in better community safety, with a commitment to \\npartnership and Indigenous control, so that services truly meet the unique \\nneeds of communities.

Given the good fortune of our history and our geography, it \\nwould be easy to turn away from the world and leave foreign problems for \\nothers to resolve.  \\nCanadians understand this would be a mistake. Whether it is climate change \\nleading to lower crop yields, which drive up the price of groceries, or political \\ninstability causing mass migration, which drives people to Canada in search of \\nrefuge, or Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, which undermines the security of \\nall countries, Canadians know that we cannot stand aside in isolation from \\nthe world. \\nCanada needs to do its part—and we have been. Rooted in a belief that the \\ndignity of people matters, we have made historic contributions to support the \\nhealth and rights of women, including pre- and post-abortion care through the \\nFeminist International Assistance Policy, and led the way with a feminist foreign \\npolicy. Canada has also doubled our international contributions to fight climate \\nchange, welcomed people fleeing violence and discrimination, and stood up for \\nour values around the world.  \\nWe took these actions because they are right—and also because a more \\npeaceful, prosperous world is in Canada’s national interest. We must do our \\npart in a world that is growing more challenging, more uncertain, and more \\ncomplex. We must make investments to make sure that future generations can \\nbenefit from the same peace and prosperity that generations of Canadians have \\nenjoyed. We have to be prepared to face these challenges, and Canada must \\nhave the tools to work with partners and allies. Doing this gives Canada greater \\ncredibility, and helps build stronger societies, allies, and partnerships.  \\nClimate change is reshaping our North, presenting new threats to our \\nsovereignty as the polar sea ice retreats, and opening up the Arctic to economic \\nand geopolitical competition. Canada must assert our sovereignty over our \\nArctic territory. Economic security is becoming a central consideration in foreign \\npolicy as disruptive state and non-state actors attempt to reshape the global \\neconomy to their advantage. The rules-based order itself is under threat.

Putin’s full-scale invasion launched in February \\n2022 has threatened Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory. Vladimir Putin is \\nseeking to undermine the very idea of freedom itself. China has become \\nincreasingly disruptive, and is seeking to capitalize on this moment of global \\nuncertainty to advance its own goals.  \\nIn the face of these challenges, and this suffering, many across Canada and \\naround the world are left to worry about what future their children and \\ngrandchildren will inherit.

We are investing in our defence to protect Canada and our allies in a \\nmore insecure world; in preserving and promoting free and open trade and \\ndeepening our economic partnerships with emerging and developing \\neconomies; and in strengthening Canada’s contributions to ending the conflicts \\nand humanitarian crises that undermine stability. \\n7.1 Protecting Canadians, at Home and Abroad  \\nThe world is at an inflection point.

Climate change is opening our Arctic to \\nforeign competitors who are pursuing their own economic opportunities, and \\npotentially seeking to do us or our Allies harm. Authoritarian leaders are trying \\nto destroy the rules-based international order, and replace it with a world where \\nmight makes right. New weapon systems and emerging technologies are \\nchanging the nature of conflict.  \\nIn response to these challenges, we must make sure the Canadian Armed \\nForces, and all the women and men who serve, have what they need to keep \\nCanada safe, no matter what.  \\nAlongside our NATO Allies, we have reinforced our defence and deterrence \\ncapabilities and readiness, including by committing to expand Canada’s troop \\ndeployment in Latvia, where the Canadian Armed Forces already lead a NATO \\nbattlegroup. We have welcomed Finland and Sweden into the alliance, \\nbolstered our support for members in Eastern Europe, and made the \\ninvestments necessary to uphold our unique role in protecting NATO’s \\nNorthern and Western Flank—our Arctic.

Since then, \\nFinDev has programmed $75.9 million in concessional financing under the \\nGAC-funded 2X Canada facility and committed close to $1.3 billion of its own \\nresources on commercial terms, with 45 private sector clients.  \\nTo further enable Canada’s efforts to engage the private sector on \\ndevelopment goals, a new phase of the International Assistance Innovation \\nProgram will focus on small, high impact transactions supporting businesses \\nand entrepreneurs. The government will also seek to leverage FinDev’s global \\nmandate and expertise to mobilize private investment in projects that cannot \\nattain commercial viability on their own.  \\nThe government intends to introduce legislative measures that would build \\non these tools and provide additional flexibilities to the program.

This is in no small part is due to our commitment \\nto progressive taxation, investments in Canada’s strong social safety net, and an \\neffective, efficient government. Together, Canada’s tax and benefit systems \\nhave supported equality of opportunity for generations of Canadians. \\nIn the last few decades, the pathways enjoyed by generations of Canadians to \\nbuild a middle class life have come under pressure. From the pandemic’s \\ndisruptions of the global economy to chronic underinvestment in housing by \\nprevious governments, the cost of living crisis and the global shift to a winner-\\ntake-all digital economy, those at the top have been getting richer while \\nyounger generations struggle to buy a first home and afford to start a family.  \\nToday, younger Canadians—through no fault of their own—are too often \\nfinding that their hard work is not paying off. That’s not fair. \\nCanada’s potential must be leveraged to fix this; we must invest to ensure \\nyounger generations have the same opportunities as those before them. \\nThat is why the federal government is taking action to build a fairer future, with \\ntransformative investments in housing, innovation, the clean economy, and in \\nyounger generations. We’ll unlock the promise of Canada, so every generation \\ncan build a better life, as their parents and grandparents did before them. It is \\ncrucial that the government make sure younger Canadians can afford to get a \\ngood education and in-demand skills, buy a home, raise a family, and build a \\ngood middle class life.  \\nCanada’s fiscally responsible economic plan and our AAA credit rating are the \\nfoundation for the stability of our economy. They make Canada a safe and \\nattractive destination for investment and create business certainty. Financing \\nthe investment we need through more debt would be unfair to young \\nCanadians—we want them to inherit prosperity, not our unpaid bills.  \\nWe have a better, fairer option. We are making the responsible choice. \\nThe government is asking the wealthiest Canadians to pay their fair share.  \\nBudget 2024 proposes new measures that will make the tax system more fair \\nand generate $21.9 billion in revenue over five years to invest in building more \\nhomes, faster, creating good-paying jobs, and incentivizing economic growth \\nthat delivers fairness for every generation.

And, due to the global corporate tax \\nrace to the bottom, the biggest multinational corporations do not always pay \\ntheir fair share.   \\nCanada’s potential must be leveraged to fix this; we must invest to ensure \\nyounger generations have the same opportunities as those before them and to \\nensure the way we fund these generational investments is fundamentally fair— \\nto Canadians today, and tomorrow. \\nOur tax system needs to work better for nurses, teachers, construction workers, \\nservers, labourers, and young professionals—those in the middle class, and \\nthose working hard to join it.

But currently, they only pay \\ntaxes on 50 per cent of capital gains, which is the profit generally made when \\nan asset, such as stocks, is sold. This is the capital gains tax advantage. \\nWhile all Canadians can benefit from the capital gains tax advantage, the \\nwealthy, who tend to earn relatively more income from capital gains, \\ndisproportionately benefit compared to the middle class (Chart 8.2). In 2021, \\nthe top 1 per cent earned 10.4 per cent of all income in Canada; when capital \\ngains are factored in, this jumps to 13.4 per cent. \\nTax fairness is important for every generation, and it is particularly significant \\nfor younger Canadians. In 2021, only about 5 per cent of Canadians under 30 \\nhad any capital gains at all. \\nThe current regime may result in situations where wealthy individuals face a \\nlower marginal tax rate on their capital gains than what a middle class worker \\nwould face on their earnings. For instance, a nurse in Ontario earning $70,000 \\nwould face a combined federal-provincial marginal tax rate of 29.7 per cent. In \\ncomparison, a wealthy individual in Ontario with $1 million of income would \\nface a marginal tax rate of 26.8 per cent on their capital gains.  \\nDifferences in taxation rates between income earned from wages, capital gains, \\nand dividends currently favour the wealthiest among us.

This tax-free limit \\nwill be increased to $1.25 million, effective June 25, 2024, and will \\ncontinue to be indexed to inflation thereafter. In 2025, Canadians with \\neligible capital gains of below $2.25 million will be better off under \\nthese changes. \\n\\xad The government will maintain the exemption for capital gains from the \\nsale of a principal residence to ensure Canadians do not pay capital \\ngains taxes when selling their home. Any amount you make when you \\nsell your home will remain tax-free. \\n\\xad To ensure homes are for Canadians to live in, not a speculative asset \\nclass for investors, since January 1, 2023, capital gains from property \\nflipping—properties bought and sold within 1 year—have been treated \\nas business income. Exemptions exist for many common life situations; \\nthese exemptions will remain. This is central to the promise of Canada. \\n\\xad To encourage entrepreneurship, the government is proposing the \\nCanadian Entrepreneurs’ Incentive which will reduce the inclusion rate \\nto 33.3 per cent on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital \\ngains. Combined with the enhanced lifetime capital gains exemption, \\nwhen this incentive is fully rolled out, entrepreneurs will have a \\ncombined exemption of at least $3.25 million when selling all or part of \\na business. \\nThe proposed higher inclusion rate on capital gains would result in more \\nequitable marginal tax rates across revenue sources and income levels. In \\nparticular, the proposal would increase the average federal-provincial marginal \\ntax rate on capital gains above $250,000 of someone earning $1 million a year, \\nto 35.7 per cent (chart 8.3).

This helps ensure objectivity and transparency, \\nand introduces an element of independence into the government’s economic \\nand fiscal forecast. The economic forecast presented in this section is based on a \\nsurvey conducted in March 2024. \\nThe March survey includes the views of 12 private sector economists: \\n− BMO Capital Markets; \\n− Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec; \\n− CIBC World Markets; \\n− The Conference Board of Canada; \\n− Desjardins; \\n− Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.; \\n− Laurentian Bank Securities; \\n− National Bank Financial Markets; \\n− Royal Bank of Canada; \\n− Scotiabank; \\n− TD Bank Financial Group; and, \\n− The University of Toronto (Policy and Economic Analysis Program). \\nThe macroeconomic inputs of the March 2024 survey provide a reasonable basis \\nfor fiscal planning. To facilitate prudent economic and fiscal planning, the \\nDepartment of Finance Canada has developed two scenarios that consider faster \\nor slower growth tracks relative to the March survey (see below for details).  \\nOverall, private sector economists have revised up their near-term growth \\noutlook in the March 2024 survey compared to the 2023 Fall Economic Statement \\n(FES 2023) outlook, but they revised down their growth outlook in 2025 and in \\nthe outer years (Table A1.1). Canada is expected to see moderate below-potential \\ngrowth over the next few quarters weighed down by the effects of past interest \\nrate increases, followed by a gradual recovery towards higher growth. Real gross \\ndomestic product (GDP) growth is projected to slow from 1.1 per cent in 2023 to \\n0.7 per cent in 2024, before rebounding to 1.9 per cent in 2025 (previously 0.5 \\nper cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively). This revised outlook will leave the level of \\nreal GDP 0.2 per cent below the FES 2023 outlook by the end of 2025. '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 371}, page_content='358   Annex 1 \\nComparisons of the March survey average to real GDP growth forecasts from \\nother institutions can be found in Table A1.2. \\nAs the economy slows, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 6.5 per \\ncent in the fourth quarter of 2024, remaining historically low and far below the \\npeaks experienced during recessions. Amid ongoing solid population growth, \\nthis adjustment is expected to largely reflect a slower pace of hiring, rather than \\na large rise in layoffs. The unemployment rate is anticipated to settle at an \\naverage of 6.3 per cent in 2025 and continue to gradually decline to 5.7 per \\ncent by 2028, similar to the FES 2023 projection. \\nPrivate sector economists expect Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation to \\ncontinue to ease and reach about 2 per cent, within the Bank of Canada’s target \\nrange, at the end of this year. On an annual basis, CPI inflation is expected to \\ndecline from 3.9 per cent in 2023 to 2.5 per cent in 2024 and to normalize to \\naround 2 per cent over the remainder of the forecast horizon, the same as in \\nFES 2023. \\nShort-term interest rates are expected to decline from an average of 4.8 per cent \\nin 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024 and to 3.1 per cent in 2025, about 20 basis points \\nhigher in each year compared to FES 2023, before settling at 2.7 per cent over the \\nlast three years of the forecast horizon. Long-term interest rates are expected to \\naverage 3.3 per cent over the forecast horizon, an upward revision of about 10 \\nbasis points on average per year compared to the FES 2023 projection. \\nIn the March survey, private sector economists expect crude oil prices to remain \\nstable and average US$78 per barrel over the forecast horizon, very similar to \\nthe FES 2023 projection. \\nGDP inflation in the second half of last year came in significantly stronger than \\nexpected in FES 2023. As a result, GDP inflation averaged 1.6 per cent for the \\nyear as a whole, compared to 1.0 per cent expected in FES 2023. As well, private \\nsector economists have revised up their outlook for 2024 to 3.0 per cent from \\n2.0 per cent in FES 2023. In the outer years, GDP inflation is expected to be \\nslightly lower than the FES 2023 projection by about 0.1 percentage points on \\naverage per year. \\nReflecting higher-than-expected GDP inflation last year and upward revisions to \\nthe GDP inflation outlook for 2024, the level of nominal GDP (the broadest \\nmeasure of the tax base) is higher than the FES 2023 projection by $18 billion in \\n2023 and $56 billion in 2024. However, because of slower real GDP growth and \\nGDP inflation in the outer years, the nominal GDP level difference with FES 2023 \\ngradually declines over the last four years of the forecast horizon to average \\n$39 billion per year over that period.

Lower projected net income from \\nenterprise Crown corporations contributes to downward revisions in the \\nnear term, but these declines level off and contribute to higher expected \\nrevenues in 2027-28 and onwards. Throughout the forecast horizon, higher \\nexpected other program and net foreign exchange revenues contribute to \\nupward revisions.  \\nThe outlook for program expenses has been revised up in early years of the \\nforecast relative to FES 2023, reflecting higher direct program expenses and \\nmajor transfers to persons. Program expenses are down in the outer years, \\nreflecting lower major transfers, lower pollution pricing proceeds returned to \\nCanadians, and slightly lower direct program expenses. \\n− Reflecting year-to-date results, major transfers to persons are slightly \\nhigher in 2023-24, including higher elderly benefits, Employment \\nInsurance benefits, and Canada Child Benefit payments, offset in part by \\nan increase in expected recoveries from benefit overpayments for \\nemergency COVID 19 income supports, relative to FES 2023. Over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon, Employment Insurance benefits are \\nhigher resulting from higher wage growth and unemployment rate \\nprojections, and Canada Child Benefit payments are slightly higher owing \\nto the carry forward of in-year results. Elderly benefits are projected to be \\nlower, owing to revisions to the projected number of beneficiaries. '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 377}, page_content='364   Annex 1 \\n− Projected major transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities have \\ndecreased slightly across the horizon due to near-term changes in the \\neconomic outlook, which result in downward revisions to Territorial \\nFormula Financing and higher projected recoveries with respect to the \\nQuebec Abatement. The declines are partially offset by an increase in \\nprojected Equalization payments, which are indexed to nominal GDP \\ngrowth. \\n− Pollution pricing proceeds returned to Canadians are lower in most years, \\nreflecting lower proceeds as discussed above, as well as revised timing of \\nreturning pollution pricing proceeds to small- and medium-sized \\nbusinesses and Indigenous governments in the jurisdiction where they \\nare generated. Over 90 per cent of proceeds are returned directly to \\nCanadians through the Canada Carbon Rebate. \\n− The outlook for direct program expenses has been revised up in 2023-24, \\nrelative to the FES 2023 forecast. Higher expenses in 2023-24 reflect \\nrevised provisions for contingent liabilities and allowances, higher \\nanticipated offshore oil and gas royalties returned to provinces, and \\nhigher refundable tax credits. Across the horizon, higher projected \\nrefundable tax credits from higher projected corporate income are \\nbroadly offset by revised timing and spending against previously \\nannounced measures and lower public service pension and benefit \\nservice costs. \\nPublic debt charges are expected to increase in 2023-24 relative to FES 2023 \\nprojections due to higher near-term borrowing requirements and higher short- \\nand long-term interest rates as forecast by private sector economists. Over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon, higher projected short- and long-term \\ninterest rates and borrowing requirements are expected to increase public debt \\ncharges relative to FES 2023 by an average of $2 billion per year. \\nNet actuarial losses, which represent the amortization of changes in the value of \\nthe government’s accrued obligations for pensions and other employee future \\nbenefits and pension fund assets, are expected to be higher in 2024-25 and \\nlower in 2025-26 and 2026-27 relative to the FES 2023 forecast, reflecting \\nupdated projections of long-term interest rates.

Strength is expected to persist into 2024-25 where personal income tax \\nrevenue is expected to grow by 4.6 per cent in part due to an increase in the \\ncapital gains inclusion rate (as outlined in Chapter 8). Over the remainder of the \\nforecast horizon, personal income tax revenue growth is projected to average \\n4.3 per cent per year. \\nCorporate income tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 10.7 per cent, to \\n$83.9 billion in 2023-24, due to lower year-to-date receipts relative to the \\nprevious year stemming from lower corporate profitability. These revenues are \\nexpected to rebound in 2024-25, supported by an increase in the capital gains \\ninclusion rate for corporations (as outlined in Chapter 8) and higher projected \\ncorporate profits. It is expected that the capital gains measure would raise \\ncorporate income tax revenues by $4.9 billion in 2024-25 and by $10.6 billion \\nover the forecast horizon. Growth in corporate income tax revenues is \\nprojected to average 3.3 per cent per year over the forecast horizon. \\nIncome taxes paid by non-residents on Canadian-sourced income, notably \\ndividends and interest payments, are expected to decline by 4.2 per cent to \\n$12.6 billion in 2023-24, reflecting weak year-to-date receipts. Over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon, growth in non-resident income tax revenues \\nis expected to average 2.4 per cent per year.  \\nExcise Tax and Duty Revenues \\nGoods and Services Tax (GST) revenues are projected to grow 12 per cent to \\n$51.5 billion in 2023-24. The high year-over-year growth rate is attributable to \\nthe impact of the additional GST rebates paid in the previous fiscal year (2022-\\n23), which reduced recorded revenues that year.  Over the remainder of the \\nforecast period, GST revenues are expected to grow on average by 3 per cent \\nper year, in line with the outlook for taxable consumption. \\nCustoms import duties are projected to decrease by 8.3 per cent to $5.6 billion \\nin 2023-24, due to weak year-to-date results driven by lower imports. Over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon, customs import duties growth is projected to \\naverage 4.7 per cent, in line with projected growth in imports. \\nOther excise taxes and duties are expected to increase to $12.9 billion in  \\n2023-24, or 6 per cent, reflecting strong year-to-date revenues, particularly for \\nluxury tax receipts and excise duties from vaping products.

The carbon price trajectory underpinning the forecast reflects \\nannual increases of $15 per tonne, from $65 per tonne, beginning in 2023-24. \\nDirect proceeds will continue to be fully returned in the provinces or territories \\nwhere they are collected, as the framework is revenue neutral for the federal \\ngovernment.  \\nEmployment Insurance Premium Revenues  \\nEmployment Insurance (EI) premium revenues are projected to grow at \\n8.3 per cent in 2023-24 based on strong year-to-date results fueled by \\ncontinued strength in the labour market. Over the forecast horizon, EI premium \\nrevenues are projected to grow at an average of 3.4 per cent, reflecting steady \\nearnings growth and strong employment numbers (see Box A1.1 for details of \\nthe outlook for the EI Operating Account). The premium rate projection is \\nforecast to fall to $1.62 per $100 of insurable earnings in 2025—26 cents lower \\nthan it was between 2013 and 2016 ($1.88).

These \\nrevenues are projected to increase by an average of 8.6 per cent in  \\n2023-24 and 2024-25, primarily due to an increase in interest and penalty \\nrevenue on tax debt as a result of higher interest rates. Over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon, other program revenue is projected to \\ncontinue to grow by 2.8 per cent on average, in part reflecting returns on \\ninvestments and proceeds collected from the Clean Fuel Regulations. \\n− Net foreign exchange revenues, which consist mainly of returns on \\nCanada’s official international reserves held in the Exchange Fund \\nAccount, are volatile and sensitive to fluctuations in foreign exchange \\nrates and foreign interest rates.

Payments are then expected to grow by 7.6 per cent in 2024-25 \\nand 4.7 in 2025-26 due to an increase in the number of eligible children and \\nindexation, before moderating to an average 3.3 per cent growth over the \\nremainder of the forecast horizon. \\nMajor Transfers to Provinces, Territories, and Municipalities \\nMajor transfers to provinces, territories and municipalities include the Canada \\nHealth Transfer (CHT), the Canada Social Transfer (CST), Equalization, Territorial \\nFormula Financing, health agreements with provinces and territories, Canada-\\nwide early learning and child care, the Canada Community-Building Fund, and \\nother fiscal arrangements.  \\nThe CHT growth guarantee of five per cent per year for five years, to be paid \\nthrough annual top-ups, will see CHT support increase from $49.4 billion in \\n2023-24 to $62.8 billion in 2028-29.  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 386}, page_content='Details of Economic and Fiscal Projections    373 \\nThe CST is legislated to grow at three per cent per year from $16.4 billion in \\n2023-24 to $19 billion in 2028-29. Equalization payments are indexed to the \\nthree-year average of nominal GDP growth and are projected to grow \\n4.2 per cent annually, on average, from $24 billion in 2023-24 to $29.4 billion in \\n2028-29.  \\nTerritorial Formula Financing is projected to grow 2.9 per cent annually, on \\naverage, due to growth in provincial/local expenditures, which are major \\ncomponents of the formula.  \\nHealth agreements with provinces and territories are projected to remain at \\n$4.3 billion per year from 2023-24 to 2026-27 reflecting $2.5 billion per year for \\ntailored bilateral agreements, $1.2 billion per year in transfers supporting home \\nand community care and mental health and addictions services that expire after \\n2026-27, and $600 million per year in transfers for long-term care that expires \\nafter 2027-28.  \\nCanada Community-Building Fund payments, which are indexed at two per cent \\nper year with increases applied in $100 million increments, are expected to grow \\nfrom $2.4 billion in 2023-24 to $2.6 billion in 2028-29.  \\nCanada-wide early learning and child care transfer payments are expected to \\nincrease from $5.6 billion in 2023-24 to $7.7 billion in 2028-29, which includes \\n$625 million over four years, beginning in 2023-24, for the Early Learning and \\nChild Care Infrastructure Fund. Investments in Canada-wide early earning and \\nchild care will create more child care spaces so more families can benefit from \\n$10-a-day child care. \\nOther fiscal arrangements are projected to decrease from -$6.7 billion in \\n2023-24 to -$8.6 billion in 2028-29 primarily due to the Quebec Abatement. \\nThis reflects the increase in the value of the historical transfer of tax points (i.e. \\ntax revenue) to Quebec in the 1960s and 1970s, which results in a \\ncommensurate reduction in cash transfers to the province. \\nPollution Pricing Proceeds Returned to Canadians \\nPollution pricing proceeds returned to Canadians, including small- and \\nmedium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments, represent the \\nreturn of all direct proceeds from the federal pollution pricing system in the \\njurisdiction from which they were collected. These transfers are projected to \\nincrease from $9.9 billion in 2023-24, to $20.9 billion by 2028-29, reflecting a \\nhigher price on carbon pollution. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 387}, page_content='374   Annex 1 \\nDirect Program Expenses  \\nDirect program expenses consist of other transfer payments administered by \\ndepartments, and departmental operating expenses. Growth is offset in part by \\nplanned expenditure reduction actions. \\nOther transfer payments administered by departments are projected to increase \\nfrom $88.7 billion in 2023-24 to $112.8 billion in 2028-29. Projected growth \\nreflects recent measures with growing profiles, such as Canadian Dental Care \\nPlan benefits, support for electric vehicle battery manufacturing, and refundable \\nclean economy investment tax credits. \\nOperating expenses reflect the cost of doing business, including the cost of \\nproviding some services directly, for more than 100 government departments, \\nagencies and Crown corporations. Operating expenses are projected to reach \\n$130.9 billion in 2023-24, to fall to $123.1 billion in 2024-25 in part from lower \\nprojected provisions for contingent liabilities, and then to reach $127.1 billion in \\n2028-29. Growth over the outer years of the horizon is driven in part by: the \\nimplementation of Canada’s new defence policy Our North, Strong and Free; and \\nemployee benefits, pensions, and other compensation. \\nPublic Debt Charges \\nPublic debt charges are expected to increase from $47.2 billion in 2023-24 to \\n$64.3 billion in 2028-29 due to higher effective interest rates and higher \\nborrowing requirements. As a share of GDP, public debt charges are projected to \\nrise to 1.8 per cent, still near historic lows, and far below the peak of 6.5 per cent \\nof GDP in the 1990s and 2.1 per cent in 2007-08 before the financial crisis. \\nNet Actuarial Losses \\nNet actuarial losses, which represent changes in the value of the government’s \\nobligations for pensions and other employee future benefits, are expected to \\ndecline over most years of the forecast horizon, from a projected loss of \\n$7.6 billion in 2023-24 to a projected net gain of $2.4 billion in 2028-29, \\nreflecting higher expected interest rates used to measure the present value of \\nthe obligations.

In contrast, the budgetary balance is \\npresented on a full accrual basis of accounting, meaning that government \\nrevenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred, \\nregardless of when the cash is received or paid.  \\nTable A1.8 provides a reconciliation of the two measures, starting with the \\nbudgetary balance.

They also include the addition of changes in asset and liability \\nbalances that have no accrual impact in a year but do result in the inflow or \\noutflow of cash, such as the payment of accounts payable. An increase in a \\nliability or decrease in an asset represents a financial source, whereas a decrease \\nin a liability or increase in an asset represents a financial requirement.

Various headwinds \\nsuch as structural imbalances in housing markets and spillovers from \\ngeopolitical tensions keep inflation and interest rates elevated for longer than \\nexpected, with adverse effects on confidence and consumer activity. At the \\nsame time, the U.S. also sees persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and \\nsubsequently slower growth. Along with a weaker economic recovery in China, \\nthis contributes to slower global growth and lower commodity prices. All these \\nfactors result in real GDP in Canada contracting by 0.7 per cent from peak to \\ntrough, compared to a period of moderate below-potential growth expected in \\nthe survey.  \\n− CPI inflation is 0.5 percentage points above the March survey, on average, \\nin 2024 and 2025. CPI inflation stays around 3 per cent until the end of \\n2024 and reaches about 2 per cent in 2026. \\n− In response to higher CPI inflation, short-term interest rates remain \\nelevated throughout 2024, with the first rate cut in the first quarter of \\nnext year—two quarters later than in the survey. Overall, short-term \\ninterest rates are up by 0.8 percentage points, on average, in 2024 and \\n2025. \\n− As a result of higher interest rates, tighter financial conditions, and \\nweaker global activity, the Canadian economy sees a mild recession in \\n2024. Real GDP contracts by 0.7 per cent from peak to trough, \\nsignificantly less than in the 2008-09 recession (-4.4 per cent). On an \\nannual basis, real GDP growth is negative in 2024 and slower than the \\nsurvey in 2025, before picking up in 2026 and 2027. \\n− Consistent with weaker economic activity, the unemployment rate rises to \\na peak of 7.0 per cent in the last quarter of 2024 and is 0.6 percentage \\npoints higher than the survey, on average, in 2025. This is significantly \\nless than in the 2008-09 recession (8.7 per cent). '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 392}, page_content='Details of Economic and Fiscal Projections    379 \\n− Despite higher CPI inflation, GDP inflation is lower than in the survey due \\nto lower commodity prices. Crude oil prices decline from US$78 per \\nbarrel in 2023 to US$71 per barrel in 2024 and US$66 per barrel in 2025 \\n(down from US$78 per barrel in the survey) and gradually converge close \\nto the survey outlook by 2028. \\n− Together, slower real GDP growth and lower GDP inflation reduce the \\nlevel of nominal GDP by $34 billion, on average per year, compared to \\nthe survey. \\nUpside Scenario  \\nIn the upside scenario, the Canadian economy sees faster economic growth than \\nin the survey. A more resilient U.S. economy—underpinned by strong balance \\nsheets for households and firms and recent supply-side improvements in \\nproductivity—benefits the Canadian economy through higher export demand \\nand improved global commodity prices. Despite more economic resilience, \\ninflation slows roughly as expected in the survey, both in Canada and globally, \\namid falling input costs. These developments result in economic growth picking \\nup faster than expected in the second half of 2024. The improved global \\noutlook, alongside extended crude oil production cuts by OPEC+, leave oil \\nprices above the survey. \\n− As a result of spillover effects from a stronger U.S. economy, the \\nCanadian economy expands at a pace close to potential over the course \\nof 2024 rather than the moderate growth expected in the March survey. \\nOn an annual basis, real GDP growth is 1.4 per cent in 2024 (up \\n0.7 percentage points from the March survey) and 2.2 per cent in 2025 \\n(up 0.3 percentage points). \\n− With a stronger economy, the unemployment rate rises by less than \\nexpected, reaching a peak of 6.2 per cent in the third quarter of 2024 \\n(compared to 6.5 per cent in the March survey) and averaging 0.4 \\npercentage points below the survey in 2025. \\n− Despite a similar pace of CPI inflation, GDP inflation is higher than in the \\nsurvey as stronger global activity results in higher commodity prices. After \\naveraging US$78 per barrel in 2023, WTI crude oil prices average US$83 \\nper barrel in 2024 and US$87 per barrel in 2025 (up from US$78 per \\nbarrel in the survey) and remain US$8 per barrel above the survey on \\naverage per year over the rest of the forecast horizon. \\n− Together, faster real GDP growth and higher GDP inflation raise the \\nlevel of nominal GDP by $34 billion, on average per year, compared to \\nthe survey. \\n  '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 393}, page_content='380   Annex 1 \\nTable A1.9 \\nDepartment of Finance Economic Scenarios  \\nPer cent, unless otherwise indicated \\n  2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 \\n2024- \\n2028   \\nReal GDP growth       \\n  Budget 2024 0.7 1.9 2.2 2.1 2.0 1.8 \\n  Downside Scenario -0.1 1.2 2.8 2.6 2.1 1.7 \\n  Upside Scenario 1.4 2.2 2.1 1.9 1.9 1.9 \\nGDP inflation       \\n  Budget 2024 3.0 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.2 \\n  Downside Scenario 2.6 1.8 2.5 2.2 2.1 2.2 \\n  Upside Scenario 3.4 2.0 1.9 2.0 1.9 2.2 \\nNominal GDP growth       \\n  Budget 2024 3.8 3.9 4.2 4.2 4.0 4.0 \\n  Downside Scenario 2.4 3.0 5.3 4.9 4.3 4.0 \\n  Upside Scenario 4.8 4.3 4.1 3.9 3.9 4.2 \\nNominal GDP level (billions of \\ndollars)       \\n  Budget 2024 2,998 3,115 3,246 3,382 3,518  \\n  Downside Scenario 2,959 3,047 3,209 3,366 3,510  \\n  Upside Scenario 3,027 3,157 3,286 3,414 3,547  \\nDifference between Budget 2024 \\nand Downside Scenario \\n \\n-39 \\n \\n-68 \\n \\n-37 \\n \\n-16 \\n \\n-8 \\n \\n-34 \\nDifference between Budget 2024 \\nand Upside Scenario \\n \\n29 \\n \\n42 \\n \\n40 \\n \\n32 \\n \\n28 \\n \\n34 \\n3-month treasury bill rate       \\n  Budget 2024 4.5 3.1 2.7 2.7 2.7 3.1 \\n  Downside Scenario 5.0 4.2 3.1 2.8 2.7 3.6 \\n  Upside Scenario 4.3 2.9 2.7 2.7 2.7 3.1 \\nUnemployment rate       \\n  Budget 2024 6.3 6.3 6.0 5.8 5.7 6.0 \\n  Downside Scenario 6.5 6.9 6.4 6.0 5.9 6.3 \\n  Upside Scenario 6.1 5.9 5.7 5.6 5.5 5.8 \\nConsumer Price Index inflation       \\n  Budget 2024 2.5 2.1 2.1 2.0 2.0 2.1 \\n  Downside Scenario 3.0 2.6 2.1 2.0 2.0 2.4 \\n  Upside Scenario 2.4 1.9 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.1 \\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil \\nprice ($US per barrel)       \\n  Budget 2024 78 78 78 78 78 78 \\n  Downside Scenario 71 66 72 75 77 72 \\n  Upside Scenario 83 87 87 85 84 85 \\nNote: Forecast averages may not equal average of years due to rounding.

Stronger nominal GDP growth results in higher income tax revenues \\nand the improved outlook for consumption would bring in higher projected \\nGST revenues. Overall, revenues are projected to be $4.5 billion higher annually, \\non average, in this scenario. On the expense side, the lower projected CPI \\ninflation and unemployment means lower expenses for CPI-indexed programs \\nand Employment Insurance benefits, bringing program expenses down by $0.8 \\nbillion on average annually. Lower interest rates mean that public debt charges \\nwould also be lower by an average of $1.8 billion annually under this scenario. \\nOverall, expenses would be $2.5 billion lower annually, on average, in the \\nupside scenario. \\nAs a result of the lower deficits and stronger nominal GDP growth, the federal \\ndebt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 37.6 per cent by 2028-29.  \\nLong-Term Debt Projections \\nAs with any projection that extends over several decades, the long-term debt-\\nto-GDP ratio projections presented in Budget 2024 are subject to a high degree \\nof uncertainty and are sensitive to assumptions. They should not be viewed as \\npredictions of the future, but instead as modelling scenarios based on a set of \\nreasonable economic and demographic assumptions, assuming no future \\nchanges in policies.  \\nBuilding on the Budget 2024 forecast, long-term fiscal projections continue to \\nindicate that federal public finances are sustainable beyond the usual forecast \\nhorizon (Chart A1.2). This is despite adverse demographic trends, including an \\naging population, assumed moderate future productivity growth rates, and \\nhigher borrowing costs. As discussed in more detail below, this conclusion is \\nalso robust to changes in assumptions, including, for example, the projected \\ngrowth rate of real GDP.

One of \\nthese fiscal objectives, keeping deficits below 1 per cent of GDP, beginning in \\n2026-27, is also particularly important in helping to ensure Canada’s fiscal \\nadvantage is preserved beyond the medium term.  \\nKeeping deficits below 1 per cent of GDP provides additional insurance that \\npublic finances remain strong beyond the medium term as Canada adapts to an \\naging population, the impacts of climate change, and the transition to net zero. \\nThis ensures Canada has the fiscal capacity to weather future shocks, such as \\nhow the federal government was able to provide temporary, emergency \\nsupports to Canadians and businesses throughout the pandemic.

In this \\nmodel, annual real GDP growth depends on labour productivity growth (1 per \\ncent per year), which is calibrated over its 1974-2019 historical average, and \\nlabour supply growth (average of 0.6 per cent per year), which is based on \\ndemographic projections produced by Statistics Canada and projections for the \\nlabour force participation rate and average hours worked using econometric \\nmodels developed by the Department. Assuming a constant 2 per cent annual \\nrate for GDP inflation, nominal GDP is projected to grow by an average of 3.6 \\nper cent per year from 2029 to 2055 (Table A1.10).  \\nTable A1.10 \\nGDP Growth Projection, Baseline Scenario, Average Annual Growth Rates  \\nper cent, unless otherwise indicated \\n   1970–2023 2024–2028 2029–2055 \\nReal GDP growth  2.6 1.8 1.6 \\nContributions of (percentage points):     \\n    Labour supply growth  1.5 0.9 0.6 \\n        Working-age population  1.5 1.6 0.8 \\n        Labour force participation  0.2 -0.6 -0.2 \\n        Unemployment rate  0.0 -0.1 0.0 \\n        Average hours worked  -0.2 -0.1 -0.1 \\n    Labour productivity growth  1.1 0.9 1.0 \\nNominal GDP growth  6.8 4.0 3.6 \\nNote: Contributions may not add up due to rounding.  \\nSources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance Canada calculations. \\nThe long-term federal debt projections are obtained through an accounting model \\nin which each revenue and expense category is modelled as a function of its \\nunderlying demographic and economic variables, with the relationships defined by \\na mix of current government policies and assumptions. The key assumptions \\nunderlying fiscal projections from 2029-30 through 2055-56 are the following: \\n− All tax revenues as well as direct program expenses grow broadly with \\nnominal GDP, with the exceptions of a number of measures that will no \\nlonger be available after a certain date (e.g., the Clean Electricity, Clean \\nTechnology, and Clean Hydrogen investment tax credits and funding to \\nsupport clean electricity projects) which are incorporated based on their \\nprojected costs.  \\n− The Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer, and Equalization \\ngrow with their respective legislated escalators.

In \\naddition, other program expenses are also lower as certain programs are \\nlinked directly to growth in nominal GDP, such as Equalization. \\n− Public debt charges decline in the first year due to lower costs associated \\nwith Real Return Bonds. \\nTable A1.15 \\nEstimated Impact of a Sustained 100-Basis-Point Increase in All Interest Rates \\non Federal Revenues, Expenses and Budgetary Balance \\nbillions of dollars \\n Year 1 Year 2 Year 5 \\nFederal revenues 1.2 2.4 5.3 \\nFederal expenses 4.9 7.9 13.0 \\nBudgetary balance -3.7 -5.5 -7.7 \\n \\nA 1 per cent increase in interest rates decreases the budgetary balance by \\n$3.7 billion in the first year, $5.5 billion in the second year, and $7.7 billion in \\nthe fifth year (Table A1.15). Higher interest rates directly impact estimated \\npublic debt charges on marketable debt in two ways. First, interest costs \\nincrease as existing debt matures and is refinanced at higher rates. Second, \\nrising rates increase the expected cost of future borrowing needs. Public debt \\ncharges are estimated based on the current expectations for future changes in \\ninterest rates, which are subject to change based on economic conditions. \\nIt is important to note that interest rates also directly affect other government \\nrevenues and expenses and that they typically do not change in isolation. That \\nis, with higher interest rates, the government would realize some offsetting \\nbenefits, including: \\n− Higher revenues from the government’s interest-bearing assets, and \\ninterest and penalty revenue on tax debt, which are recorded as part of \\nother revenues; \\n− Corresponding downward adjustments that reduce the valuations of \\npublic sector pensions and employee benefits obligations, which are not \\nincorporated in the table above; and, \\n− Higher government tax revenues if interest rate increases were due to \\nstronger economic growth (also not included in the table above). \\nEven with a 1 per cent increase in interest rates, public debt charges are \\nsustainable and would remain near historic lows as a proportion of GDP.

The 2024-25 Debt \\nManagement Strategy fulfills this requirement. \\nObjectives \\nThe fundamental objectives of debt management are to raise stable and low-\\ncost funding to meet the financial requirements of the Government of Canada \\nand to maintain a well-functioning market for Government of Canada securities.  \\nThe government is committed to managing the debt program in a prudent \\nmanner to ensure a balanced debt structure that contributes to maintaining the \\nstability of debt costs and to reducing the risk of the debt portfolio. \\nHaving access to a well-functioning government securities market contributes \\nto lower costs and less volatile pricing for the government, ensuring that funds \\ncan be raised efficiently over time to meet the government’s financial \\nrequirements.  \\nThe Debt Management Strategy provides transparency on the government’s \\nborrowing plans to support a liquid and well-functioning market for \\nGovernment of Canada securities and ensures the long-term sustainability of \\nthe government’s borrowing program.  \\nThe government closely monitors financial markets and will adjust issuance if \\nnecessary to appropriately respond to shifts in market demand or changes to \\nfinancial requirements.  \\nOutlook for Government of Canada Debt \\nAs a result of the government’s responsible fiscal management, Canada \\ncontinues to have an enviable fiscal and debt position relative to international \\npeers. Canada is projected to have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio and is '), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 409}, page_content=\"396   Annex 2 \\nexpected to have some of the strongest fiscal outcomes of G7 countries over \\nthe next five years. Rating agencies cite Canada's effective, stable, and \\npredictable policymaking and political institutions, economic resilience and \\ndiversity, well-regulated financial markets, and its monetary and fiscal flexibility \\nas drivers of Canada’s world-leading credit ratings: Moody’s (Aaa), S&P (AAA), \\nDBRS (AAA), and Fitch (AA+). \\nPlanned Borrowing Activities for 2024-25 \\nThe projected sources and uses of borrowings for 2024-25 are presented in \\nTable A2.1. The comparison of actual sources and uses of borrowings against \\nprojections will be reported in the Debt Management Report for 2024-25. This \\ndocument will be released soon after the Public Accounts of Canada 2025, \\nwhich will provide detailed accounting information on the government’s \\ninterest-bearing debt. \\nSources of Borrowings \\nThe aggregate principal amount of money to be borrowed by the government \\nin 2024-25 is projected to be $508 billion, 83 per cent of which will be used to \\nrefinance maturing debt. This level of borrowing is consistent with the current \\nlegislated limit of $1,831 billion set out in the Borrowing Authority Act and the \\ngovernment has received approval from Governor in Council for a related \\nannual borrowing limit for 2024-25. The government proposes to introduce \\namendments to the Borrowing Authority Act to increase the government’s total \\nborrowing limit to ensure Canadians continue to receive the important benefits \\nand services to which they are entitled. \\nUses of Borrowings \\nThe size of the 2024-25 gross issuance of domestic bonds and treasury bills  \\n(i.e., domestic borrowing program) totals $500 billion and reflects requirements to \\nrefinance $414 billion of maturing debt, in addition to projected financial \\nrequirements of $102 billion, which includes $30 billion to fund purchases of \\nCanada Mortgage Bonds and a reduction of cash balances of $16 billion. The \\ngovernment also intends to borrow an equivalent of $8 billion in foreign currencies, \\nsolely for the purpose of funding its official international reserves (more details \\nbelow). \\nActual borrowings for the year may differ due to uncertainty associated with \\neconomic and fiscal projections, the timing of cash transactions, and other factors \\nsuch as changes in foreign reserve needs and Crown corporation borrowings. To \\nadjust for these unexpected changes in financial requirements, debt issuance may \\nbe altered during the year, typically first through changes in the issuance of \\ntreasury bills. The government may also adjust issuance for bonds in response to \\nlarger changes or shifts in market demand. \"), Document(metadata={'source': './doc/budget-2024.pdf', 'page': 410}, page_content='Debt Management Strategy    397 \\nTable A2.1 \\nPlanned/Actual Sources and Uses of Borrowings for 2024-25 \\nbillions of dollars \\n Sources of borrowings \\n  Payable in Canadian Currency  \\n    Treasury bills1 272 \\n      Bonds 228 \\n  Total payable in Canadian currency 500 \\n  Payable in foreign currencies 8 \\nTotal sources of borrowings 508 \\n Uses of borrowings \\nRefinancing needs   \\n  Payable in Canadian Currency  \\n      Treasury bills 267 \\n      Bonds 147 \\n      Retail debt 0 \\n  Total payable in Canadian currency 414 \\n  Payable in foreign currencies 7 \\nTotal refinancing needs 421 \\nFinancial requirement   \\n  Budgetary balance 40 \\n  Non-budgetary transactions  \\n      Pension and other accounts -6 \\n      Non-financial assets 5 \\n      Loans, investments, and advances  \\n      Of which:  \\n        Loans to enterprise Crown corporations 42 \\n        Other 6 \\n      Other transactions2 16 \\nTotal financial requirement 102 \\nTotal uses of borrowings 523 \\nNet increase or decrease (-) in cash  -16 \\nChange in other unmatured debt transactions3 0 \\nSource: Department of Finance Canada calculations. \\nNotes: Numbers may not add due to rounding.

Canada is the first sovereign borrower to issue a green bond \\nincluding certain nuclear expenditures, demonstrating Canada’s commitment to \\nbeing a global nuclear leader. \\nCanada’s second green bond offering saw robust demand from environmentally \\nand socially responsible investors who represented a majority of buyers (66 per \\ncent), as well as from international investors, who made up over 33 per cent of the \\ninvestor base. The final order book stood at over $7.4 billion. \\nCanada’s green bond program is supporting the growth of the sustainable finance \\nmarket in Canada, and around the world, and advancing Canada’s investments in \\nclean growth, renewable energy, climate action, and environmental protection. The \\ngovernment remains committed to regular green bond issuances. \\nLegislative Proposals to Support the Canada \\nMortgage Bond Program \\nIn the 2023 Fall Economic Statement, the Government of Canada announced \\nthat, to help spur housing construction across the country, it would buy up to \\n$30 billion of Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMBs). The government officially \\nstarted these CMB purchases on February 14, 2024, and purchased a total of \\n$7.5 billion CMBs in February and March 2024.  \\nTo support the purchases, two legislative amendments are being proposed \\nthrough Budget 2024.  \\nIn the fall of 2023, the government increased the annual limit for Canada \\nMortgage Bonds from $40 billion to $60 billion, to unlock low-cost financing for \\nmulti-unit rental construction and help build up to 30,000 more rental \\napartments per year. To facilitate this and ensure the Canada Mortgage and \\nHousing Corporation (CMHC) can continue to support multi-unit rental \\nconstruction, Budget 2024 proposes to increase the insurance-in-force and \\nguarantees-in-force legislative limits under the National Housing Act to \\n$800 billion.
